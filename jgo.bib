                 with a prosthetic device that acts and feels like one's
                 own limb is a major goal in applied neuroscience.
                 Recent studies in nonhuman primates have shown that
                 motor control and sensory feedback can be achieved by
                 connecting sensors in a robotic arm to electrodes
                 implanted in the brain. However, it remains unknown
                 whether electrical brain stimulation can be used to
                 create a sense of ownership of an artificial limb. In
                 this study on two human subjects, we show that
                 ownership of an artificial hand can be induced via the
                 electrical stimulation of the hand section of the
                 somatosensory (SI) cortex in synchrony with touches
                 applied to a rubber hand. Importantly, the illusion was
                 not elicited when the electrical stimulation was
                 delivered asynchronously or to a portion of the SI
                 cortex representing a body part other than the hand,
                 suggesting that multisensory integration according to
                 basic spatial and temporal congruence rules is the
                 underlying mechanism of the illusion. These findings
                 show that the brain is capable of integrating natural
                 visual input and direct cortical-somatosensory
                 stimulation to create the multisensory perception that
                 an artificial limb belongs to one's own body. Thus,
                 they serve as a proof of concept that electrical brain
                 stimulation can be used to bypass the peripheral
                 nervous system to induce multisensory illusions and
                 ownership of artificial body parts, which has important
                 implications for patients who lack peripheral sensory
                 input due to spinal cord or nerve lesions.",

                 sensory feedback in future prosthetic and
                 rehabilitative applications. Here, we evaluate human
                 subjects' ability to continuously modulate their motor
                 behavior based on feedback from direct surface
                 stimulation of the somatosensory cortex. Subjects wore
                 a dataglove that measured their hand aperture position
                 and received one of three stimuli over the hand sensory
                 cortex based on their current hand position as compared
                 to a target aperture position. Using cortical
                 stimulation feedback, subjects adjusted their hand
                 aperture to move towards the target aperture region.
                 One subject was able to achieve accuracies and R(2)
                 values well above chance (best performance: R(2) =
                 0.93; accuracy = 0.76/1). Performance dropped during
                 the catch trial (same stimulus independent of the
                 position) to below chance levels, suggesting that the
                 subject had been using the varied sensory feedback to
                 modulate their motor behavior. To our knowledge, this
                 study represents one of the first demonstrations of
                 using direct cortical surface stimulation of the human
                 sensory cortex to perform a motor task, and is a first
                 step towards developing closed-loop human sensorimotor
                 brain-computer interfaces.",
