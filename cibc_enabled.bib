                 technology have set the stage for routine derivation of
                 patient- and disease-specific human iPSC-cardiomyocyte
                 (CM) models for preclinical drug screening and
                 personalized medicine approaches. Peripheral blood
                 mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are an advantageous source of
                 somatic cells because they are easily obtained and readily
                 amenable to transduction. Here, we report that the
                 electrophysiological properties and pharmacological
                 responses of PBMC-derived iPSC CM are generally similar to
                 those of iPSC CM derived from other somatic cells, using
                 patch-clamp, calcium transient, and multielectrode array
                 (MEA) analyses. Distinct iPSC lines derived from a single
                 patient display similar electrophysiological features and
                 pharmacological responses. Finally, we demonstrate that
                 human iPSC CMs undergo acute changes in calcium-handling
                 properties and gene expression in response to rapid
                 electrical stimulation, laying the foundation for an
                 in-vitro-tachypacing model system for the study of human
