  abstract =     "Optimizing lead placement in transvenous
                 defibrillation remains central to the clinical aspects
                 of the defibrillation procedure. Studies involving
                 superior vena cava (SVC) return electrodes have found
                 that left ventricular (LV) leads or septal positioning
                 of the right ventricular (RV) lead minimizes the
                 voltage defibrillation threshold (VDFT) in endocardial
                 lead-->SVC defibrillation systems. However, similar
                 studies have not been conducted for active-can
                 configurations. The goal of this study was to determine
                 the optimal lead position to minimize the VDFT for
                 systems incorporating an active can. This study used a
                 high resolution finite element model of a human torso
                 that includes the fiber architecture of the ventricular
                 myocardium to find the role of lead positioning in a
                 transvenous LEAD-->can defibrillation electrode system.
                 It was found that, among single lead systems, posterior
                 positioning of leads in the right ventricle lowers
                 VDFTs appreciably. Furthermore, a septal location of
                 leads resulted in lower VDFTs than free-wall
                 positioning. Increasing the number of leads, and thus
                 the effective lead surface area in the right ventricle
                 also resulted in lower VDFTs. However, the lead
                 configuration that resulted in the lowest VDFTs is a
                 combination of mid-cavity right ventricle lead and a
                 mid-cavity left ventricle lead. The addition of a left
                 ventricular lead resulted in a reduction in the size of
                 the low gradient regions and a change of its location
                 from the left ventricular free wall to the septal
                 wall.",

  abstract =     "Models of myocardial membrane dynamics have not been
                 able to reproduce the experimentally observed negative
                 bias in the asymmetry of transmembrane potential
                 changes (DeltaVm) induced by strong electric shocks
                 delivered during the action potential plateau. The goal
                 of this study is to determine what membrane model
                 modifications can bridge this gap between simulation
                 and experiment. We conducted simulations of shocks in
                 bidomain fibers and sheets with membrane dynamics
                 represented by the LRd'2000 model. We found that in the
                 fiber, the negative bias in DeltaVm asymmetry could not
                 be reproduced by addition of electroporation only, but
                 by further addition of hypothetical outward current,
                 Ia, activated upon strong shock-induced depolarization.
                 Furthermore, the experimentally observed rectangularly
                 shaped positive DeltaVm, negative-to-positive DeltaVm
                 ratio (asymmetry ratio) = approximately 2,
                 electroporation occurring at the anode only, and the
                 increase in positive DeltaVm caused by L-type
                 Ca2+-channel blockade were reproduced in the strand
                 only if Ia was assumed to be a part of K+ flow through
                 the L-type Ca2+-channel. In the sheet, Ia not only
                 contributed to the negative bias in DeltaVm asymmetry
                 at sites polarized by physical and virtual electrodes,
                 but also restricted positive DeltaVm. Inclusion of Ia
                 and electroporation is thus the bridge between
                 experiment and simulation.",

  abstract =     "Background The relationship between epicardial and
                 body surface potentials defines the forward problem of
                 electrocardiography. A robust formulation of the
                 forward problem is instrumental to solving the inverse
                 problem, in which epicardial potentials are computed
                 from known body surface potentials. Here the accuracy
                 of different forward models has been evaluated
                 experimentally. Methods and Results: Body surface and
                 epicardial potentials were recorded simultaneously in
                 anesthetized closed-chest pigs (n=5) during sinus
                 rhythm, and epicardial and endocardial ventricular
                 pacing (65 records in total). Body surface potentials
                 were simulated from epicardial recordings using
                 experiment-specific volume conductor models constructed
                 from MRI. Results for homogeneous (isotropic electric
                 properties) and inhomogeneous (incorporating lungs,
                 anisotropic skeletal muscle and subcutaneous fat)
                 forward models were compared with measured body surface
                 potentials. Correlation coefficients were 0.85-0.08
                 across all animals and activation sequences with no
                 significant difference between homogeneous and
                 inhomogeneous solutions (p-value=0.85). Despite this,
                 there was considerable variance between simulated and
                 measured body surface potential distributions.
                 Differences between the body surface potential extrema
                 predicted with homogeneous forward models were 55-78\%
                 greater than observed (p-value<0.05) and attenuation of
                 potentials adjacent to extrema were 10-171\% greater
                 (p-value<0.03). The length and orientation of the
                 vector between potential extrema were also
                 significantly different. Inclusion of inhomogeneous
                 electrical properties in the forward model reduced, but
                 did not eliminate these differences. Conclusions:These
                 results demonstrate that homogeneous volume conductor
                 models introduce substantial spatial inaccuracies in
                 forward problem solutions. This likely impacts on the
                 precision of inverse reconstructions of cardiac
                 potentials in which this assumption is made.",

                 active can ICDs without transvenous shocking coils or
                 epicardial patches. An immature and mature pig were
                 anesthetized and ventilated. A pacing lead was inserted
                 in the right ventricle for fibrillation induction and
                 rate sensing. Subcutaneous arrays were positioned in
                 the right and left chest walls. An ICD emulator was
                 placed in abdominal and prepectoral pockets.
                 Fluoroscopic images were acquired for each electrical
                 vector configuration (array --> can, can --> array,
                 array --> array, array + array --> can). Ventricular
                 fibrillation was induced and DFT testing performed.
                 Defibrillation was achieved in all ten trials in the
                 immature piglet, with DFT < or = 9 J, regardless of
                 vector configuration. Using a single subcutaneous array
                 and active can, the shock impedance ranged from 28-36
                 ohms. With two arrays, shocking impedance fell to 15-22
                 ohms. In the adult pig, defibrillation was not
                 accomplished with maximum energy of 40 J, using all
                 vector configurations. Using data garnered from these
                 experiments, this technique was then successfully
                 performed in a 2-year-old child with VT and repaired
                 congenital heart disease, needing an ICD. This study
                 demonstrates the feasibility of leadless ICD
                 implantation in an immature animal and successful
                 implementation in a small child. A single subcutaneous
                 array and active can resulted in excellent implant
                 characteristics and DFTs with a minimally invasive
                 approach. Defibrillation was not possible in a larger
                 animal, possibly due to maximal available energy. This

  abstract =     "Optical mapping of arrhythmias and defibrillation
                 provides important insights; however, a limitation of
                 the technique is signal distortion due to photon
                 scattering. The goal of this experimental/simulation
                 study is to investigate the role of three-dimensional
                 photon scattering in optical signal distortion during
                 ventricular tachycardia (VT) and defibrillation. A
                 three-dimensional realistic bidomain rabbit ventricular
                 model was combined with a model of photon transport.
                 Shocks were applied via external electrodes to induce
                 sustained VT, and transmembrane potentials (V(m)) were
                 compared with synthesized optical signals (V(opt)).
                 Fluorescent recordings were conducted in isolated
                 rabbit hearts to validate simulation results. Results
                 demonstrate that shock-induced membrane polarization
                 magnitude is smaller in V(opt) and in experimental
                 signals as compared to V(m). This is due to
                 transduction of potentials from weakly polarized
                 midmyocardium to the epicardium. During shock-induced
                 reentry and in sustained VT, photon scattering,
                 combined with complex wavefront dynamics, results in
                 optical action potentials near a filament exhibiting
                 i), elevated resting potential, ii), reduced amplitude
                 relative to pacing, and iii), dual-humped morphologies.
                 A shift of up to 4 mm in the phase singularity location
                 was observed in V(opt) maps when compared to V(m). This
                 combined experimental/simulation study provides an
                 interpretation of optical recordings during VT and
                 defibrillation.",

@Article{JDT:Bis2011,
  abstract =     "Although the cardiac bidomain model has been widely
                 used in the simulation of electrical activation, its
                 relatively computationally expensive nature means that
                 monodomain approaches are generally required for
                 long-duration simulations (for example, investigations
                 of arrhythmia mechanisms). However, the presence of a
                 conducting bath surrounding the tissue is known to
                 induce wavefront curvature (surface leading bulk), a
                 phenomena absent in standard monodomain approaches.
                 Here, we investigate the biophysical origin of the
                 bidomain bath-loading induced wavefront curvature and
                 present a novel augmented monodomain-equivalent
                 bidomain approach faithfully replicating all aspects of
                 bidomain wavefront morphology and conduction velocity,
                 but with a fraction of the computational cost.
                 Bath-loading effects are shown to be highly dependent
                 upon specific conductivity parameters, but less
                 dependent upon the thickness or conductivity of the
                 surrounding bath, with even relatively thin surrounding
                 fluid layers (~ 0.1 mm) producing significant wavefront
                 curvature in bidomain simulations. We demonstrate that
                 our augmented monodomain approach can be easily adapted
                 for different conductivity sets and applied to
                 anatomically complex models, thus facilitating fast and
                 accurate simulation of cardiac wavefront dynamics
                 during long-duration simulations, further aiding the
                 faithful comparison of simulations with experiments.",

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: The direct role of coronary vessels in
                 defibrillation, although hypothesized to be important,
                 remains to be elucidated. We investigated how
                 vessel-induced virtual electrode polarizations assist
                 reentry termination. METHODS AND RESULTS: A highly
                 anatomically detailed rabbit ventricular slice bidomain
                 computer model was constructed from 25-mum magnetic
                 resonance data, faithfully representing both structural
                 and electric properties of blood vessels. For
                 comparison, an equivalent simplified model with
                 intramural cavities filled in was also built. Following
                 fibrillation induction, 6 initial states were selected,
                 and biphasic shocks (5-70 V) were applied using a
                 realistic implanted cardioverter-defibrillator
                 electrode configuration. A fundamental mechanism of
                 biphasic defibrillation was uncovered in both models,
                 involving successive break excitations (after each
                 shock phase) emanating from opposing myocardial
                 surfaces (in septum and left ventricle), which rapidly
                 closed down excitable gaps. The presence of vessels
                 accelerated this process, achieving more-rapid and
                 successful defibrillation. Defibrillation failed in 5
                 cases (all because of initiation of new activity)
                 compared with 8 with the simplified model (5/8 failures
                 because of surviving activity). At stronger shocks,
                 virtual electrodes formed around vessels, rapidly
                 activating intramural tissue because of break
                 excitations, assisting the main defibrillation
                 mechanism, and eliminating all activity \<15 ms of
                 shock end in 60\% of successful shocks (36\% in
                 simplified model). Subsequent analysis identified that
                 only vessels \>200 mum in diameter participated through
                 this mechanism. Consequently, wavefronts could survive
                 intramurally in the simplified model, leading to
                 reentry and shock failure. CONCLUSIONS: We provide new
                 insight into defibrillation mechanisms by showing how
                 intramural blood vessels facilitate more-effective
                 elimination of existing wavefronts, rapid closing down
                 of excitable gaps, and successful defibrillation and
                 give guidance toward the required resolution of cardiac
                 imaging and model generation endeavors for mechanistic
                 defibrillation analysis.",

                 ventricular fibrillation during the vulnerable period,
                 we determined the defibrillation threshold in 22
                 open-chest dogs using epicardial defibrillation

                 shocks of various energy through these same electrodes
                 during the repolarization phase of paced rhythm. The
                 above determinations were also made with the anode at
                 the ventricular apex and the cathode at the right

                 another eight of the dogs. In all dogs for all
                 electrode configurations, there was an upper limit to
                 the shock strength that induced ventricular
                 fibrillation during the vulnerable period. Depending on

                 vulnerability and that shocks slightly lower than the

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND In the canine model, an upper limit of
                 shock strength exists that can induce ventricular
                 fibrillation during the vulnerable period of the
                 cardiac cycle. This shock strength (the upper limit of
                 vulnerability) closely correlates with the
                 defibrillation threshold and supports the upper limit
                 of vulnerability hypothesis of defibrillation. It is
                 not known whether an upper limit of vulnerability
                 exists in humans or whether this limit correlates with
                 the defibrillation threshold. METHODS AND RESULTS In 13
                 patients undergoing implantable
                 cardioverter-defibrillator implantation, the shock
                 strengths associated with a 50\% probability of
                 reaching the upper limit of vulnerability (ULV50) and a
                 50\% probability of reaching the defibrillation
                 threshold (DFT50) were determined by the up-down
                 algorithm. The ULV50 was determined only for the
                 mid-upslope of the positive T waves and for the
                 mid-downslope of the negative T waves. No major
                 complications occurred during surgery. An upper limit
                 of vulnerability was demonstrated in each patient. The
                 ULV50 was 300 +/- 138 V or 6.8 +/- 5.8 J, which was
                 significantly lower than the DFT50 of 347 +/- 167 V (p
                 = 0.038) or 9.1 +/- 7.3 J (p = 0.013). The correlation
                 between the ULV50 and the DFT50 was significant (r =
                 0.90, p < 0.001 for voltage; r = 0.93, p < 0.001 for
                 energy). CONCLUSIONS An upper limit of vulnerability is
                 present in humans. There is a significant correlation
                 between the ULV50 and the DFT50, and the ULV50 is
                 significantly lower than the DFT50.",

                 effectiveness of antiarrhythmic treatment by the
                 wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD). BACKGROUND:
                 Effectiveness of the WCD for prevention of sudden death
                 is dependent on event type, patient compliance and
                 appropriate management of ventricular
                 tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF). METHODS: Compliance
                 and events were recorded in a nation-wide registry of
                 post-market release WCDs. Survival, using the Social
                 Security Death Index, was compared with survival in
                 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) patients.
                 RESULTS: Of 3569 patients wearing the WCD (age
                 59.3$\pm$14.7, duration 52.6 +/i 69.9 days), daily use
                 was 19.9$\pm$4.7 hours (>90{\%} of the day) in 52{\%}
                 of patients. More days of use correlated with higher
                 daily use (p<0.001). Eighty sustained VT/VF events
                 occurred in 59 patients (1.7{\%}). First shock success
                 was 76/76 (100{\%}) for unconscious VT/VF and 79/80
                 (99{\%}) for all VT/VF. Eight patients died after
                 successful conversion of unconscious VT/VF (survival
                 89.5{\%} of VT/VF events). Asystole occurred in 23 (17
                 died), pulseless electrical activity in 2 and
                 respiratory arrest in 1 (3 died), representing 24.5{\%}
                 of sudden cardiac arrests. During WCD use, 3541/3569
                 patients (99.2{\%}) survived overall. Survival occurred
                 in 72/80 (90{\%}) VT/VF events and 78/106 (73.6{\%})
                 for all events. Long-term mortality was not
                 significantly different from first ICD implant patients
                 but highest among patients with traditional ICD
                 indications. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance was satisfactory
                 with 90{\%} wear time in >50{\%} of patients and low
                 sudden death mortality during usage. Survival was
                 comparable to that of implantable ICD patients.
                 However, asystole was an important cause of mortality
                 in sudden cardiac arrest events.",

	Abstract = {The accurate generation of forward models is an important element in general research in electrocardiography, and in particular for the techniques for ElectroCardioGraphic Imaging (ECGI). Recent research efforts have been devoted to the reliable and fast generation of forward models. However, these model can suffer from several sources of inaccuracy, which in turn can lead to considerable error in both the forward simulation of body surface potentials and even more so for ECGI solutions. In particular, the accurate localization of the heart within the torso is sensitive to movements due to respiration and changes in position of the subject, a problem that cannot be resolved with better imaging and segmentation alone. Here, we propose an algorithm to localize the position of the heart using electrocardiographic recordings on both the heart and torso surface over a sequence of cardiac cycles. We leverage the dependency of electrocardiographic forward models on the underlying geometry to parameterize the forward model with respect to the position (translation) and orientation of the heart, and then estimate these parameters from heart and body surface potentials in a numerical inverse problem. We show that this approach is capable of localizing the position of the heart in synthetic experiments and that it reduces the modeling error in the forward models and resulting inverse solutions in canine experiments. Our results show a consistent decrease in error of both simulated body surface potentials and inverse reconstructed heart surface potentials after re-localizing the heart based on our estimated geometric correction. These results suggest that this method is capable of improving electrocardiographic models used in research settings and suggest the basis for the extension of the model presented here to its application in a purely inverse setting, where the heart potentials are unknown.},

In this work we investigate how the constitutive and geometrical parameters associated with such anatomical heterogeneities, represented by endo/epicardial surfaces and intramural surfaces in the form of blood-vessels, affect the virtual electrode patterns produced.   Methods and results The steady-state bidomain model is used to obtain, using analytical and numerical methods, the virtual electrode patterns created around idealized endocardial trabeculations and blood-vessels. The virtual electrode pattern around blood-vessels is shown to be composed of two dominant effects; current traversing the vessel surface and conductivity heterogeneity from the fibre-architecture. The relative magnitudes of these two effects explain the swapping of the virtual electrode polarity observed, as a function of the vessel radius, and aid in the understanding of the virtual electrode patterns predicted by numerical bidomain modelling. The relatively high conductivity of blood, compared to myocardium, is shown to cause stronger depolarizations in the endocardial trabeculae grooves than the protrusions.   Conclusions The results provide additional quantitative understanding of the virtual electrodes produced by small-scale ventricular anatomy, and highlight the importance of faithfully representing the physiology and the physics in the context of computational modelling of field stimulation.},

                 important to improve efficacy and minimize post-shock
                 sequelae. Previous work has suggested an improvement in
                 shock success when an intracardiac shock is delivered
                 synchronized to the upslope of a VF wave. We
                 investigated the efficacy of transthoracic
                 defibrillation success using a novel external biphasic
                 defibrillator which delivers shocks synchronized to the
                 upslope of the surface ECG. METHODS: A prospective,
                 controlled, randomized study in a research institute
                 laboratory of male and female pigs (54.2+/-1.8 kg).
                 Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced in 10
                 anaesthetized and ventilated pigs. Shocks were
                 delivered randomly from a biphasic defibrillator in
                 synchronized or non-synchronized mode via self-adhesive
                 electrode pads following 30 s of VF. Energy settings at
                 50, 70, 80, and 100J were randomly tested. VF
                 amplitude, impedance, and shock outcome were recorded
                 and analysed digitally. RESULTS: A total of 300 shocks
                 were delivered. Synchronized shocks were delivered on
                 the upslope of the VF wave in 99\% of cases. There was
                 no significant difference in shock success between
                 shocks delivered in synchronized or non-synchronized
                 modes (p=0.695). There was no significant difference in
                 the amplitude of VF between successful and unsuccessful
                 shocks (p=0.163). Furthermore, there was no association
                 between shock success and transthoracic impedance.
                 CONCLUSION: The novel defibrillator used in this study
                 was able to consistently deliver shocks on the upslope
                 portion of the VF wave but did not show an improvement

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: The function of the Purkinje system (PS)
                 is to ensure fast and uniform activation of the heart.
                 Although this vital role during sinus rhythm is well
                 understood, this is not the case when shocks are
                 applied to the heart, especially in the case of failed
                 defibrillation. The PS activates differently from the
                 myocardium, has different electrophysiological
                 properties, and provides alternate propagation
                 pathways; thus, there are many ways in which it can
                 contribute to postshock behavior. OBJECTIVE: The
                 purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of the
                 PS in the initiation and maintenance of postshock
                 arrhythmias. METHODS: A computer model of the
                 ventricles including the PS was subjected to different
                 reentry induction protocols. RESULTS: The PS
                 facilitated reentry induction at relatively weaker
                 shocks. Disconnecting the PS from the ventricles during
                 the post-shock interval revealed that the PS helps
                 stabilize early-stage reentry by providing focal
                 breakthroughs. During later stages, the PS contributed
                 to reentry by leading to higher frequency rotors. The
                 PS also promoted wave front splitting during reentry
                 due to electrotonic coupling, which prolongs action
                 potential durations at PS-myocyte junctions. The
                 presence of a PS results in the anchoring of reentrant
                 activations that propagate through the pathways
                 provided by the PS. CONCLUSIONS: The PS is
                 proarrhythmic in that it provides pathways that prolong
                 activity, and it plays a supplementary role in
                 maintaining the later stages of reentry (\>800 ms).",

                 usage of the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD)
                 during mandated waiting periods following myocardial
                 infarction (MI) for patients perceived to be at high
                 risk for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). BACKGROUND:
                 Current device guidelines and insurance coverage
                 require waiting periods of either 40 days or 3 months
                 before implanting a cardioverter-defibrillator
                 post-myocardial infarction (MI), depending on whether
                 or not acute revascularization was undertaken. METHODS:
                 We assessed characteristics of and outcomes for
                 patients who had a WCD prescribed in the first 3 months
                 post-MI. The WCD medical order registry was searched
                 for patients who were coded as having had a recent MI
                 with ejection fraction </=35\% or given an
                 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
                 Revision 410.xx diagnostic code (acute MI), and then
                 matched to device-recorded data. RESULTS: Between
                 September 2005 and July 2011, 8,453 unique patients
                 (age 62.7 +/- 12.7 years, 73\% male) matched study
                 criteria. A total of 133 patients (1.6\%) received 309
                 appropriate shocks. Of these patients, 91\% were
                 resuscitated from a ventricular arrhythmia. For shocked
                 patients, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
                 was </=30\% in 106, 30\% to 35\% in 17, >36\% in 8, and
                 not reported in 2 patients. Of the 38\% of patients not
                 revascularized, 84\% had a LVEF </=30\%; of the 62\% of
                 patients revascularized, 77\% had a LVEF </=30\%. The
                 median time from the index MI to WCD therapy was 16
                 days. Of the treated patients, 75\% received treatment
                 in the first month, and 96\% within the first 3 months
                 of use. Shock success resulting in survival was 84\% in
                 nonrevascularized and 95\% in revascularized patients.
                 CONCLUSIONS: During the 40-day and 3-month waiting
                 periods in patients post-MI, the WCD successfully
                 treated SCA in 1.4\%, and the risk was highest in the
                 first month of WCD use. The WCD may benefit individual
                 patients selected for high risk of SCA early post-MI.",

                 implantation or are unable to receive an implantable

                 patients could benefit from a wearable cardioverter
                 defibrillator. Patients with symptomatic heart failure
                 and an ejection fraction of <0.30 (WEARIT Study) or
                 patients having complications associated with high risk
                 for sudden death after a myocardial infarction or
                 bypass surgery not receiving an ICD for up to 4 months
                 (BIROAD Study) were enrolled into two studies. After a
                 total of 289 patients had been enrolled in the trial
                 (177 in WEARIT and 112 in BIROAD), prespecified safety
                 and effectiveness guidelines had been met. Six (75\%)
                 of eight defibrillation attempts were successful. Six
                 inappropriate shock episodes occurred during 901 months
                 of patient use (0.67\% unnecessary shocks per month of
                 use). Twelve deaths occurred during the study 6 sudden
                 deaths: 5 not wearing and 1 incorrectly wearing the
                 device). Most patients tolerated the device although 68
                 patients quit due to comfort issues or adverse
                 reactions. The results of the present study suggest
                 that a wearable defibrillator is beneficial in

                 tachyarrhythmias in patients at high risk for sudden
                 death who are not clear candidates for an ICD and may
                 be useful as a bridge to transplantation or ICD in some

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND:In body surface potential mapping,
                 increased spatial sampling is used to allow more
                 accurate detection of a cardiac abnormality. Although
                 diagnostically superior to more conventional
                 electrocardiographic techniques, the perceived
                 complexity of the Body Surface Potential Map (BSPM)
                 acquisition process has prohibited its acceptance in
                 clinical practice. For this reason there is an interest
                 in striking a compromise between the minimum number of
                 electrocardiographic recording sites required to sample
                 the maximum electrocardiographic information.
                 METHODS:In the current study, several techniques widely
                 used in the domains of data mining and knowledge
                 discovery have been employed to mine for diagnostic
                 information in 192 lead BSPMs. In particular, the
                 Single Variable Classifier (SVC) based filter and
                 Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) based wrapper
                 approaches to feature selection have been implemented
                 and evaluated. Using a set of recordings from 116
                 subjects, the diagnostic ability of subsets of 3, 6, 9,
                 12, 24 and 32 electrocardiographic recording sites have
                 been evaluated based on their ability to correctly
                 asses the presence or absence of Myocardial Infarction
                 (MI). RESULTS:It was observed that the wrapper
                 approach, using sequential forward selection and a 5
                 nearest neighbour classifier, was capable of choosing a
                 set of 24 recording sites that could correctly classify
                 82.8 \% of BSPMs. Although the filter method performed
                 slightly less favourably, the performance was
                 comparable with a classification accuracy of 79.3 \%.
                 In addition, experiments were conducted to show how (a)
                 features chosen using the wrapper approach were
                 specific to the classifier used in the selection model,
                 and (b) lead subsets chosen were not necessarily
                 unique. CONCLUSION:It was concluded that both the
                 filter and wrapper approaches adopted were suitable for
                 guiding the choice of recording sites useful for
                 determining the presence of MI. It should be noted
                 however that in this study recording sites have been
                 suggested on their ability to detect disease and such
                 sites may not be optimal for estimating body surface
                 potential distributions.",

                 used to evaluate nonthoracotomy lead configurations for
                 implantable defibrillators. A lead configuration that
                 consisted of a left ventricular catheter and four
                 circumferential cutaneous patches was tested because it
                 was hypothesized to create a relatively uniform
                 electric field for defibrillation. In eight
                 anesthetized dogs, three 8F defibrillating catheters
                 with 6 cm platinum clad titanium tips were inserted
                 into the right ventricle (R), right ventricular outflow
                 tract (O), and left ventricle (L). Four cutaneous patch
                 electrodes (4P), each with a surface area of 42 cm2,
                 were placed on the left lateral, right lateral,
                 anterior and posterior thorax. DFTs for ten lead
                 configurations, consisting of different combinations of
                 these electrodes, were evaluated. DFTs were determined
                 by using a modified Purdue technique and applying a
                 single capacitor biphasic shock with both phases 6 ms
                 in duration after 15 sec of electrically induced
                 fibrillation. The L(-)----4P+ configuration produced a
                 lower DFT than R(-)----4P+ (3.2 +/- 1.6 J vs 8.0 +/-
                 4.2 J, P less than 0.001) with reduced current (2.6 +/-
                 0.7 A vs 4.1 +/- 1.2 A, P less than 0.001). Lowering
                 the impedance by a mean of 40\%, configurations that
                 used four patches produced lower DFTs than those that
                 used a single left lateral patch. The use of an O
                 catheter produced lower DFTs only when used in
                 conjunction with an R catheter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

abstract="The resistivity of swine liver tissue was measured in vivo, during induced ischaemia and post-mortem, so that associated changes in resistivity could be quantified. Plunge electrodes, the four-terminal method and a computer-automated measurement system were used to acquire resistivities between 10 Hz and 1 MHz. Liver resistivity was measured in vivo in three animals at 11 locations. At 10 Hz, resistivity was 758{\textpm}170 $\Omega${\textperiodcentered}cm. At 1 MHz, the resistivity was 250{\textpm}40$\Omega${\textperiodcentered}cm. The resistivity time course was measured during the first 10 min after the liver blood supply in one animal had been occluded. Resistivity increased steadily during occlusion. The change in resistivity of an excised tissue sample was measured during the first 12h after excision in one animal. Resistivity increased during the first 2h by 53{\%} at 10 Hz and by 32{\%} at 1MHz. After 2h, resistivity decreased, probably owing to membrane breakdown. The resistivity data were fitted to a Cole-Cole circle, from which extracellular resistance Re, intracellular resistance Ri and cell membrane capacitance Cm were estimated. Re increased during the first 2h by 95{\%} and then decreased, suggesting an increase in extracellular volume. Cm increased during the first 4h by 40{\%}, possibly owing to closure of membrane channels, and then decreased, suggesting membrane breakdown. Ri stayed constant during the initial 6h and then increased.",

                 electrotherapy that terminates ventricular tachycardia
                 (VT) when antitachycardia pacing (ATP) fails.
                 BACKGROUND: High-energy implantable
                 cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks are associated
                 with device failure, significant morbidity, and
                 increased mortality. A low-energy alternative to ICD
                 shocks is desirable. METHODS: Myocardial infarction was
                 created in 25 dogs. Sustained, monomorphic VT was
                 induced by programmed stimulation. Defibrillation
                 electrodes were placed in the right ventricular apex,
                 and coronary sinus and left ventricular epicardium. If
                 ATP failed to terminate sustained VT, the
                 defibrillation thresholds (DFTs) of standard versus
                 experimental electrotherapies were measured. RESULTS:
                 Sustained VT ranged from 276 to 438 beats/min (mean 339
                 beats/min). The right ventricular-coronary sinus shock
                 vector had lower impedance than the right
                 ventricular-left ventricular patch (54.4 +/- 18.1 Omega
                 versus 109.8 +/- 16.9 Omega; p < 0.001). A single shock
                 required between 0.3 +/- 0.2 J to 5.9 +/- 2.5 J (mean
                 2.64 +/- 3.22 J; p = 0.008) to terminate VT, and varied
                 depending upon the phase of the VT cycle in which it
                 was delivered. By contrast, multiple shocks delivered
                 within 1 VT cycle length were not phase dependent and
                 achieved lower DFT compared with a single shock (0.13
                 +/- 0.09 J for 3 shocks, 0.08 +/- 0.04 J for 5 shocks,
                 and 0.09 +/- 0.07 J for 7 shocks; p < 0.001). Finally,
                 a multistage electrotherapy (MSE) achieved
                 significantly lower DFT compared with a single biphasic
                 shock (0.03 +/- 0.05 J versus 2.37 +/- 1.20 J;
                 respectively, p < 0.001). At a peak shock amplitude of
                 20 V, MSE achieved 91.3\% of terminations versus 10.5\%
                 for a biphasic shock (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MSE
                 achieved a major reduction in DFT compared with a
                 single biphasic shock for ATP-refractory monomorphic
                 VT, and represents a novel electrotherapy to reduce
                 high-energy ICD shocks.",

                 electrotherapy (MSE) to terminate atrial fibrillation
                 (AF). BACKGROUND: Previous attempts to perform
                 cardioversion of AF by using an implantable device were
                 limited by the pain caused by use of a high-energy
                 single biphasic shock (BPS). METHODS: Transvenous leads
                 were implanted into the right atrium (RA), coronary
                 sinus, and left pulmonary artery of 14 dogs.
                 Self-sustaining AF was induced by 6 +/- 2 weeks of
                 high-rate RA pacing. Atrial defibrillation thresholds
                 of standard versus experimental electrotherapies were
                 measured in vivo and studied by using optical imaging
                 in vitro. RESULTS: The mean AF cycle length (CL) in
                 vivo was 112 +/- 21 ms (534 beats/min). The impedances
                 of the RA-left pulmonary artery and RA-coronary sinus
                 shock vectors were similar (121 +/- 11 Omega vs. 126
                 +/- 9 Omega; p = 0.27). BPS required 1.48 +/- 0.91 J
                 (165 +/- 34 V) to terminate AF. In contrast, MSE
                 terminated AF with significantly less energy (0.16 +/-
                 0.16 J; p < 0.001) and significantly lower peak voltage
                 (31.1 +/- 19.3 V; p < 0.001). In vitro optical imaging
                 studies found that AF was maintained by localized foci
                 originating from pulmonary vein-left atrium interfaces.
                 MSE Stage 1 shocks temporarily disrupted localized
                 foci; MSE Stage 2 entrainment shocks continued to
                 silence the localized foci driving AF; and MSE Stage 3
                 pacing stimuli enabled consistent RA-left atrium
                 activation until sinus rhythm was restored.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Low-energy MSE significantly reduced the
                 atrial defibrillation thresholds compared with BPS in a
                 canine model of AF. MSE may enable painless,
                 device-based AF therapy.",

  abstract =     "Promising results have been reported in noninvasive
                 estimation of cardiac activation times (AT) using the
                 equivalent dipole layer (EDL) source model in
                 combination with the boundary element method (BEM).
                 However, the assumption of equal anisotropy ratios in
                 the heart that underlies the EDL model does not reflect
                 reality. In the present study, we quantify the errors
                 of the nonlinear AT imaging based on the EDL
                 approximation. Nine different excitation patterns
                 (sinus rhythm and eight ectopic beats) were simulated
                 with the monodomain model. Based on the bidomain
                 theory, the body surface potential maps (BSPMs) were
                 calculated for a realistic finite element volume
                 conductor with an anisotropic heart model. For the
                 forward calculations, three cases of bidomain
                 conductivity tensors in the heart were considered:
                 isotropic, equal, and unequal anisotropy ratios in the
                 intra- and extracellular spaces. In all inverse
                 reconstructions, the EDL model with BEM was employed:
                 AT were estimated by solving the nonlinear optimization
                 problem with the initial guess provided by the fastest
                 route algorithm. Expectedly, the case of unequal
                 anisotropy ratios resulted in larger localization
                 errors for almost all considered activation patterns.
                 For the sinus rhythm, all sites of early activation
                 were correctly estimated with an optimal regularization
                 parameter being used. For the ectopic beats, all but
                 one foci were correctly classified to have either endo-
                 or epicardial origin with an average localization error
                 of 20.4 mm for unequal anisotropy ratio. The obtained
                 results confirm validation studies and suggest that
                 cardiac anisotropy might be neglected in clinical
                 applications of the considered EDL-based inverse

                 (ICDs) save lives, but the defibrillation shocks
                 delivered by these devices produce substantial pain,
                 presumably due to skeletal muscle activation. In this
                 study, we tested an electrode system composed of
                 epicardial panels designed to shield skeletal muscles
                 from internal defibrillation, but allow penetration of
                 an external electric field to enable external
                 defibrillation when required. METHODS AND RESULTS:
                 Eleven adult mongrel dogs were studied under general
                 anesthesia. Internal defibrillation threshold (DFT) and
                 shock-induced skeletal muscle force at various biphasic
                 shock strengths were compared between two electrode
                 configurations: (1) a transvenous coil placed in the
                 right ventricle (RV) as cathode and a dummy can placed
                 subcutaneously in the left infraclavicular fossa as
                 anode (control configuration) and (2) RV coil as
                 cathode and the multielectrode epicardial sock with the
                 panels connected together as anode (sock-connected).
                 External DFT was also tested with these electrode
                 configurations, as well as with the epicardial sock
                 present, but with panels disconnected from each other
                 (sock-disconnected). Internal DFT was higher with
                 sock-connected than control (24 +/- 7 J vs. 16 +/- 6 J,
                 P < 0.02), but muscle contraction force at DFT was
                 greatly reduced (1.3 +/- 1.3 kg vs. 10.6 +/- 2.2 kg, P
                 < 0.0001). External defibrillation was never
                 successful, even at 360 J, with sock-connected, while
                 always possible with sock-disconnected. CONCLUSION:
                 Internal defibrillation with greatly reduced skeletal
                 muscle stimulation can be achieved using a novel
                 electrode system that also preserves the ability to
                 externally defibrillate when required. This system may
                 provide a means for painless ICD therapy.",

                 to damaged heart tissue (myocardial ischaemia).
                 Although one method for detecting myocardial ischaemia
                 involves changes in the ST segment of the
                 electrocardiogram, the relationship between these
                 changes and subendocardial ischaemia is not fully
                 understood. In this study, we modelled ST-segment
                 epicardial potentials in a slab model of cardiac
                 ventricular tissue, with a central ischaemic region,
                 using the bidomain model, which considers conduction
                 longitudinal, transverse and normal to the cardiac
                 fibres. We systematically quantified the effect of
                 uncertainty on the input parameters, fibre rotation
                 angle, ischaemic depth, blood conductivity and six
                 bidomain conductivities, on outputs that characterise
                 the epicardial potential distribution. We found that
                 three typical types of epicardial potential
                 distributions (one minimum over the central ischaemic
                 region, a tripole of minima, and two minima flanking a
                 central maximum) could all occur for a wide range of
                 ischaemic depths. In addition, the positions of the
                 minima were affected by both the fibre rotation angle
                 and the ischaemic depth, but not by changes in the
                 conductivity values. We also showed that the magnitude
                 of ST depression is affected only by changes in the
                 longitudinal and normal conductivities, but not by the
                 transverse conductivities.",

The advantage of this approach is that it is a meshless method, so it is far easier to implement numerically than many other approaches. However, determining the heart surface potential distribution is still an ill-posed problem and thus requires some form of Tikhonov regularisation to obtain the required distributions. In this study, several methods for determining an “optimal” regularisation parameter are compared in the context of solving the inverse problem of electrocardiology via the Method of Fundamental Solutions. It is found that the Robust Generalised Cross-Validation method most often yields epicardial potential distributions with the least relative error when compared to the input distribution. The study also compares the inverse solutions obtained with the Method of Fundamental Solutions with those obtained in a previous study using the boundary element method. It is found that choosing the best solution methodology and regularisation parameter determination method depends on the particular scenario being considered."

  abstract =     "Arrhythmias, S-T segment changes, immediate
                 refibrillation, and other signs of dysfunction are
                 often observed after clinical and experimental
                 transthoracic defibrillation. In vitro studies
                 suggested that shock-induced dysfunction is induced by
                 sarcolemmal dielectric breakdown accompanied by ionic
                 exchanges through transient, shock-induced microlesions
                 in the sarcolemma. To test this hypothesis, cultured
                 chick embryo myocardial cells were shocked in media
                 containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextrans
                 (FITC-dextrans) ranging in molecular mass from 4 to 70
                 kDa, using electric field stimulation 5 ms in duration
                 and ranging in intensity from 0 to 200 V/cm. Results
                 showed that the percentage of cells incorporating 4- to
                 20-kDa dextrans increased in a dose-dependent manner.
                 The 4- and 10-kDa dextrans were incorporated beginning
                 at intensities of 50-100 V/cm. Dextran incorporation
                 corresponded with shock intensities which produced a
                 shock-induced arrest of spontaneous contraction lasting
                 1 min. The 20-kDa dextrans were incorporated following
                 150- and 200-V/cm shocks. Shocks of these intensities
                 also produced a transient postshock contracture. Larger
                 dextrans (40 and 70 kDa) were not incorporated. These
                 results suggest the formation of transient sarcolemmal

                 acute AF while the reduction in chronic AF group was
                 not significant. There was no significant increase in
                 creatinine kinase nor reduction in blood pressure, but
                 prolonged pause after successful defibrillation
                 required ventricular supporting pacing. We conclude
                 that transvenous atrial defibrillation is a safe and
                 effective means for defibrillating both acute and
                 chronic AF. ADFT was lower in acute AF than in chronic
                 AF. ADFT was highly reproducible during repeated
                 defibrillation. Sotalol reduced ADFT in acute AF and to
                 a lesser extent in chronic AF, and increased the
                 defibrillation success rate. Ventricular pacing will
                 often be required because of prolonged pause after
                 successful defibrillation.",

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: We previously showed that the
                 cardioversion threshold (CVT) for ventricular
                 tachycardia (VT) is phase dependent when a single
                 monophasic shock (1MP) is used. OBJECTIVE: The purpose
                 of this study was to extend these findings to a
                 biphasic shock (1BP) and to compare the efficacy of
                 phase-independent multiple monophasic (5MP) and
                 biphasic shocks (5BP). METHODS: Panoramic optical
                 mapping with blebbistatin (5 microM) was performed in
                 postmyocardial infarction rabbit hearts (n = 8).
                 Flecainide (1.64 +/- 0.68 microM) was administered to
                 promote sustained arrhythmias. 5MP and 5BP were applied
                 within one VT cycle length (CL). Results were compared
                 to 1BP and antitachycardia pacing. RESULTS: We observed
                 monomorphic VT with CL = 149.6 +/- 18.0 ms. Similar to
                 1MP, CVTs of 1BP were found to be phase dependent, and
                 the maximum versus minimum CVT was 8.6 +/- 1.7 V/cm
                 versus 3.7 +/- 1.9 V/cm, respectively (P = .0013).
                 Efficacy of 5MP was higher than that of 1BP and 5BP.
                 CVT was 3.2 +/- 1.4 V/cm for 5MP versus 5.3 +/- 1.9
                 V/cm for 5BP (P = .00027). 5MP versus averaged 1BP CVT
                 was 3.6 +/- 2.1 V/cm versus. 6.8 +/- 1.5 V/cm,
                 respectively (P = .00024). Antitachycardia pacing was
                 found to be completely ineffective in this model.
                 CONCLUSION: Maintenance of shock-induced virtual
                 electrode polarization by multiple monophasic shocks
                 over a VT cycle is responsible for unpinning of reentry
                 leading to self-termination. Elimination of virtual
                 electrode polarization by shock polarity reversal
                 during multiple biphasic shocks proved ineffective. A
                 significant reduction in CVT can be achieved by
                 applying multiple monophasic shocks within one VT CL or
                 one single shock at the proper coupling interval.",

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: Implantable device therapy of atrial
                 fibrillation (AF) is limited by pain from high-energy
                 shocks. We developed a low-energy multistage
                 defibrillation therapy and tested it in a canine model
                 of AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: AF was induced by burst
                 pacing during vagus nerve stimulation. Our novel
                 defibrillation therapy consisted of 3 stages: stage
                 (ST) 1 (1-4 low-energy biphasic [BP] shocks), ST2 (6-10
                 ultralow-energy monophasic [MP] shocks), and ST3
                 (antitachycardia pacing). First, ST1 testing compared
                 single or multiple MP and BP shocks. Second, several
                 multistage therapies were tested: ST1 versus ST1+ST3
                 versus ST1+ST2+ST3. Third, 3 shock vectors were
                 compared: superior vena cava to distal coronary sinus,
                 proximal coronary sinus to left atrial appendage, and
                 right atrial appendage to left atrial appendage. The
                 atrial defibrillation threshold (DFT) of 1 BP shock was
                 <1 MP shock (0.55 +/- 0.1 versus 1.38 +/- 0.31 J,
                 P=0.003). Two to 3 BP shocks terminated AF with lower
                 peak voltage than 1 BP or 1 MP shock and with lower
                 atrial DFT than 4 BP shocks. Compared with ST1 therapy
                 alone, ST1+ST3 lowered the atrial DFT moderately (0.51
                 +/- 0.46 versus 0.95 +/- 0.32 J, P=0.036), whereas
                 3-stage therapy (ST1+ST2+ST3) dramatically lowered the
                 atrial DFT (0.19 +/- 0.12 versus 0.95 +/- 0.32 J for
                 ST1 alone, P=0.0012). Finally, the 3-stage therapy was
                 equally effective for all studied vectors. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Three-stage electrotherapy significantly reduces the AF
                 DFT and opens the door to low-energy atrial
                 defibrillation at or below the pain threshold.",

                 the efficacy of a totally subcutaneous, anteroposterior
                 defibrillation shock pathway using a long time-constant
                 shock waveform that emulates a proposed device having
                 approximately twice the capacitance and thus twice the
                 available energy of traditional transvenous devices.
                 BACKGROUND: A non-transvenous defibrillation system
                 potentially offers advantages over a transvenous system
                 including simplification of the implant procedure and
                 reduction of the impact of device complications by
                 eliminating the need to place a lead within the heart.
                 Previous non-transvenous defibrillation efficacy
                 studies have been reported using anterolateral and
                 anterior-anterior shock vectors. An external
                 anteroposterior shock vector has demonstrated superior
                 efficacy compared to anterolateral shock vectors but a
                 prospective study on an anteroposterior shock vector
                 with implanted electrodes has not been previously
                 reported. METHODS: The non-transvenous shock vector
                 consisted of an anterior low pectorally-placed active
                 can emulator electrode and a posterior subcutaneous
                 coil electrode. The shock waveform was a biphasic with
                 50\% tilt per phase and a time constant of decay of 12
                 ms. Defibrillation efficacy was characterized using a
                 step-down defibrillation threshold protocol (35 J, 25
                 J, 15 J). RESULTS: A total of 33 patients with standard
                 ICD indications were enrolled in the study with 32
                 fully completing the protocol. The patient population
                 was 69\% male, with a mean age of 59 +/- 12 years. Mean
                 ejection fraction was 27 +/- 12\%. Of the 32 patients
                 tested, 26 patients (81\%) were successfully
                 defibrillated at 35 J or less, 18 patients were
                 defibrillated at 25 J or less and 9 patients were
                 successfully defibrillated at 15 J. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Defibrillation using a long time-constant waveform
                 delivered through an anteroposterior non-transvenous
                 pathway including a pectoral active can emulator
                 electrode and a posterior subcutaneous coil electrode
                 is feasible with over 80\% of patients defibrillated
                 successfully using 35 J or less.",

  abstract =     "In case of chest pain, immediate diagnosis of
                 myocardial ischemia is required to respond with an
                 appropriate treatment. The diagnostic capability of the
                 electrocardiogram (ECG), however, is strongly limited
                 for ischemic events that do not lead to ST elevation.
                 This computational study investigates the potential of
                 different electrode setups in detecting early ischemia
                 at 10 minutes after onset: standard 3-channel and
                 12-lead ECG as well as body surface potential maps
                 (BSPMs). Further, it was assessed if an additional ECG
                 electrode with optimized position or the right-sided
                 Wilson leads can improve sensitivity of the standard
                 12-lead ECG. To this end, a simulation study was
                 performed for 765 different locations and sizes of
                 ischemia in the left ventricle. Improvements by adding
                 a single, subject specifically optimized electrode were
                 similar to those of the BSPM: 2--11{\%} increased
                 detection rate depending on the desired specificity.
                 Adding right-sided Wilson leads had negligible effect.
                 Absence of ST deviation could not be related to
                 specific locations of the ischemic region or its
                 transmurality. As alternative to the ST time integral
                 as a feature of ST deviation, the K point deviation was
                 introduced: the baseline deviation at the minimum of
                 the ST-segment envelope signal, which increased 12-lead
                 detection rate by 7{\%} for a reasonable threshold.",

                 defibrillation threshold and successful postoperative
                 termination of induced ventricular fibrillation (VF)
                 with the automatic implantable cardioverter
                 defibrillator (AICD), 33 patients who underwent AICD
                 implantation were studied. The defibrillation
                 threshold, determined after at least 10 seconds of VF,
                 was 5 J in 2, 10 J in 6, 15 J in 10, 20 J in 10 and 25
                 J in 5 patients. The AICD energy rating on the first
                 discharge was 28 +/- 1.8 J. Defibrillation of induced
                 VF was demonstrated postoperatively in 29 of 33 (88\%)
                 patients. The AICD terminated VF postoperatively in all
                 18 patients with a defibrillation threshold of 15 J.
                 Only 11 of the 15 (73\%) patients with a defibrillation
                 threshold of 20 J (p < 0.04) had VF terminated
                 postoperatively. In all 4 patients in whom the AICD
                 failed to terminate induced VF, the energy difference
                 between the AICD rating and the defibrillation
                 threshold was 10 J. Among the 14 patients with a
                 difference of 10 J between the AICD energy rating and
                 the defibrillation threshold, there were no significant
                 differences between the 4 patients with and the 10
                 without successful VF termination with respect to the
                 duration of VF induced postoperatively or the AICD lead
                 system. In summary, failure to terminate VF with the
                 AICD is not uncommon (27\%) when the defibrillation
                 threshold approaches the energy delivering capacity of
                 the AICD. A margin of >10 J between the AICD energy
                 rating and the defibrillation threshold should be
                 sought by modifying lead type, size and position or by
                 selecting the appropriate energy rating of the AICD
                 device.",

                 feedback-controlled resonant drift pacing as a method
                 for low energy defibrillation. Antitachycardia pacing
                 is the only low energy defibrillation approach to have
                 gained clinical significance, but it is still
                 suboptimal. Low energy defibrillation would avoid
                 adverse side effects associated with high voltage
                 shocks and allow the application of implantable
                 cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy, in cases
                 where such therapy is not tolerated today. We present
                 results of computer simulations of a bidomain model of
                 cardiac tissue with human atrial ionic kinetics.
                 Reentry was initiated and low energy shocks were
                 applied with the same period as the reentry, using
                 feedback to maintain resonance. We demonstrate that
                 such stimulation can move the core of reentrant
                 patterns, in the direction that depends on the location
                 of the electrodes and the time delay in the feedback.
                 Termination of reentry is achieved with shock strength
                 one-order-of-magnitude weaker than in conventional
                 single-shock defibrillation. We conclude that resonant
                 drift pacing can terminate reentry at a fraction of the
                 shock strength currently used for defibrillation and
                 can potentially work where antitachycardia pacing
                 fails, due to the feedback mechanisms. Success depends
                 on a number of details that these numerical simulations
                 have uncovered.",

                 and increasingly complex computational frameworks for
                 simulating cardiac tissue electrophysiology. The goal
                 of these simulations is often to represent the detailed
                 physiology and pathologies of the heart using codes
                 that exploit the computational potential of
                 high-performance computing architectures. These
                 developments have rapidly progressed the simulation
                 capacity of cardiac virtual physiological human style
                 models; however, they have also made it increasingly

                 tissue. We compare two possible feedback algorithms for
                 timing of the shocks: a local feedback algorithm 11
                 (using an external electrode placed directly on the
                 tissue) and a global feedback algorithm 22 (using the
                 electrocardiogram). Our main results are: application
                 of the external current causes a parametric resonant
                 drift similar to that reported in previous model
                 computations; the ratio of the threshold of elimination

                 of conventional single shock defibrillation in our
                 model for cardiac tissue is about 0.5, while earlier,

                 show that an important factor for successful
                 defibrillation is the location of the feedback
                 electrode and the best results are achieved if the
                 feedback electrode or the ECG lead is located at the

  abstract =     "This study focuses on examining whether higher degrees
                 of disorganization requires higher shock strengths to
                 defibrillate and whether microscopic conductivity
                 fluctuations favor shock success. METHODS AND RESULTS:
                 We developed a three-dimensional computer bidomain
                 model of a block of cardiac tissue with straight fibers
                 immersed in a conductive bath. The membrane behavior
                 was described by the Courtemanche human atrial action
                 potential model incorporating electroporation and an
                 acetylcholine- (ACh) dependent potassium current.
                 Intracellular conductivities were varied stochastically
                 around nominal values with variations of up to 50\%. A
                 single rotor reentry was initiated and, by adjusting
                 the spatial ACh variation, the level of organization
                 could be controlled. The single rotor could be
                 stabilized or spiral wave breakup could be provoked
                 leading to fibrillatory-like activity. For each level
                 of organization, multiple shock timings and strengths
                 were applied to compute the probability of shock
                 success as a function of shock strength. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Our results suggest that the level of the small-scale
                 conductivity fluctuations is a very important factor in
                 defibrillation. A higher variation significantly lowers
                 the required shock strength. Further, we demonstrated
                 that success also heavily depends on the level of
                 organization of the fibrillatory episode. In general,
                 higher levels of disorganization require higher shock
                 strengths to defibrillate.",

                 tachycardia (VT) and atrial fibrillation has shown
                 promising results; however, the mechanisms and full
                 range of applications remain unexplored. OBJECTIVES: To
                 elucidate the mechanisms for low-voltage cardioversion
                 and defibrillation and to develop an optimal
                 low-voltage defibrillation protocol. METHODS: We
                 developed a detailed magnetic resonance imaging-based
                 computational model of the rabbit right ventricular
                 wall. We applied multiple low-voltage far-field stimuli
                 of various strengths (</=1 V/cm) and stimulation rates
                 in VT and ventricular fibrillation (VF). RESULTS: Of
                 the 5 stimulation rates tested, stimuli applied at 16\%
                 or 88\% of the VT cycle length (CL) were most effective
                 in cardioverting VT, the mechanism being consecutive
                 excitable gap decreases. Stimuli given at 88\% of the
                 VF CL defibrillated successfully, whereas a faster
                 stimulation rate (16\%) often failed because the fast
                 stimuli did not capture enough tissue. In this model,
                 defibrillation threshold energy for multiple
                 low-voltage stimuli at 88\% of VF CL was 0.58\% of the
                 defibrillation threshold energy for a single strong
                 biphasic shock. Based on the simulation results, a
                 novel 2-stage defibrillation protocol was proposed. The
                 first stage converted VF into VT by applying
                 low-voltage stimuli at times of maximal excitable gap,
                 capturing large tissue volume and synchronizing
                 depolarization; the second stage terminated VT. The
                 energy required for successful defibrillation using
                 this protocol was 57.42\% of the energy for low-voltage
                 defibrillation when stimulating at 88\% of VF CL.
                 CONCLUSIONS: A novel 2-stage low-voltage defibrillation
                 protocol using the excitable gap extent to time
                 multiple stimuli defibrillated VF with the least energy
                 by first converting VF into VT and then terminating
                 VT.",

                 novel lead system placed in the middle cardiac vein
                 with a conventional non-thoracotomy lead system.
                 METHODS: In eight pigs (weighing 35-71 kg), an
                 electrode was advanced transvenously to the right
                 ventricular apex (RV), with the proximal electrode in
                 the superior caval vein (SCV). Middle cardiac vein
                 (MCV) angiography was used to delineate the anatomy
                 before a three electrode system (length 2 x 25 mm + 1 x
                 50 mm) was positioned in the vein. An active housing
                 (AH) electrode was implanted in the left pectoral
                 region. Ventricular fibrillation was induced and
                 biphasic shocks were delivered by an external
                 defibrillator. The defibrillation threshold was
                 measured and the electrode configurations randomised
                 to: RV-->AH, RV+MCV-->AH, MCV-->AH, and RV-->SCV+AH.
                 RESULTS: For these configurations, mean (SD)
                 defibrillation thresholds were 27.3 (9.6) J, 11.9 (2.9)
                 J, 15.2 (4.3) J, and 21.8 (9.3) J, respectively. Both
                 electrode configurations incorporating the MCV had
                 defibrillation thresholds that were significantly less
                 than those observed with the RV-->AH (p < 0.001) and
                 RV-->SCV+AH (p < 0.05) configurations. Necropsy
                 dissection showed that the MCV drained into the
                 coronary sinus at a location close to its orifice (mean
                 distance = 2.7 (2.2) mm). The MCV bifurcated into two
                 main branches that drained the right and left
                 ventricles, the left branch being the dominant vessel
                 in the majority (6/7) of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Placement
                 of specialised defibrillation electrodes within the
                 middle cardiac vein provides more effective
                 defibrillation than a conventional tight ventricular
                 lead.",

  abstract =     "The effects of the discrete cellular structure on
                 propagation of electrical excitation in cardiac muscle
                 were studied in a one-dimensional fiber model
                 containing a periodic intercalated disk structure.
                 Globally, the macroscopic velocity of propagation
                 follows the behavior associated with propagation in a
                 continuous tissue (except for high values of disk
                 resistance). In addition, the computed spatial
                 extracellular potential along the fiber is a smooth
                 biphasic waveform and does not reflect the underlying
                 discrete cellular structure of the tissue. Other
                 results of the simulations demonstrate the
                 discontinuous nature of propagation and the importance
                 of the structure in arrhythmogenesis. Vmax displays a
                 biphasic behavior as a function of increasing
                 intercalated disk resistance. An initial paradoxical
                 increase in Vmax (with a simultaneous decrease in
                 conduction velocity) is followed by a decrease that
                 leads to decremental propagation and conduction block.
                 The time constant of the foot of the action potential
                 (tau foot) increases monotonically with increasing
                 intercalated disk resistance. An increase in the
                 leakage current to extracellular space brings about a
                 significant decrease in the action potential duration
                 and a loss of the plateau. This major effect is
                 accompanied by a relatively smaller decrease in
                 conduction velocity. Collision of two activation
                 wavefronts results in a significant (100\%) increase in

                 ventricular tachycardia (VT) is still one of the most
                 challenging procedures in cardiac electrophysiology,
                 limited, in part, by unmappable arrhythmias that are
                 nonsustained or poorly tolerated. Calculation of the
                 inverse solution from body surface potential mapping
                 (sometimes known as ECG imaging) has shown tremendous
                 promise and can rapidly map these arrhythmias, but we
                 lack quantitative assessment of its accuracy in humans.
                 We compared inverse solution mapping with computed
                 tomography{\textendash}registered electroanatomic
                 epicardial contact catheter mapping to study the
                 resolution of this technique, the influence of
                 myocardial scar, and the ability to map VT. Methods and
                 Results{\textemdash}For 4 patients undergoing
                 epicardial catheter mapping and ablation of VT,
                 120-lead body surface potential mappings were obtained
                 during implantable defibrillator pacing, catheter
                 pacing from 79 epicardial sites, and induced VT.
                 Inverse epicardial electrograms computed using
                 individualized torso/epicardial surface geometries
                 extracted from computed tomography images were compared
                 with registered electroanatomic contact maps. The
                 distance between estimated and actual epicardial pacing
                 sites was 13{\textpm}9 mm over normal myocardium with
                 no stimulus-QRS delay but increased significantly over
                 scar (P=0.013) or was close to scar (P=0.014). Contact
                 maps during right ventricular pacing correlated closely
                 to inverse solution isochrones. Maps of inverse
                 epicardial potentials during 6 different induced VTs

  abstract =     "Uncertainty surrounding ohmic tissue conductivity
                 impedes accurate calculation of the electric fields
                 generated by non-invasive brain stimulation. We present
                 an efficient and generic technique for uncertainty and
                 sensitivity analyses, which quantifies the reliability
                 of field estimates and identifies the most influential
                 parameters. For this purpose, we employ a non-intrusive
                 generalized polynomial chaos expansion to compactly
                 approximate the multidimensional dependency of the
                 field on the conductivities. We demonstrate that the
                 proposed pipeline yields detailed insight into the
                 uncertainty of field estimates for transcranial
                 magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct
                 current stimulation (tDCS), identifies the most
                 relevant tissue conductivities, and highlights
                 characteristic differences between stimulation methods.
                 Specifically, we test the influence of conductivity
                 variations on (i) the magnitude of the electric field
                 generated at each gray matter location, (ii) its normal
                 component relative to the cortical sheet, (iii) its
                 overall magnitude (indexed by the 98th percentile), and
                 (iv) its overall spatial distribution. We show that TMS
                 fields are generally less affected by conductivity
                 variations than tDCS fields. For both TMS and tDCS,
                 conductivity uncertainty causes much higher uncertainty
                 in the magnitude as compared to the direction and
                 overall spatial distribution of the electric field.
                 Whereas the TMS fields were predominantly influenced by
                 gray and white matter conductivity, the tDCS fields
                 were additionally dependent on skull and scalp
                 conductivities. Comprehensive uncertainty analyses of
                 complex systems achieved by the proposed technique are
                 not possible with classical methods, such as Monte
                 Carlo sampling, without extreme computational effort.
                 In addition, our method has the advantages of directly
                 yielding interpretable and intuitive output metrics and
                 of being easily adaptable to new problems.",

  abstract =     "OBJECTIVE: Transcranial direct current stimulation
                 (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique to
                 modify neural excitability. Using multi-array tDCS, we
                 investigate the influence of inter-individually varying
                 head tissue conductivity profiles on optimal electrode
                 configurations for an auditory cortex stimulation.
                 APPROACH: In order to quantify the uncertainty of the
                 optimal electrode configurations, multi-variate
                 generalized polynomial chaos expansions of the model
                 solutions are used based on uncertain conductivity
                 profiles of the compartments skin, skull, gray matter,
                 and white matter. Stochastic measures, probability
                 density functions, and sensitivity of the quantities of
                 interest are investigated for each electrode and the
                 current density at the target with the resulting
                 stimulation protocols visualized on the head surface.
                 MAIN RESULTS: We demonstrate that the optimized
                 stimulation protocols are only comprised of a few
                 active electrodes, with tolerable deviations in the
                 stimulation amplitude of the anode. However, large
                 deviations in the order of the uncertainty in the
                 conductivity profiles could be noted in the stimulation
                 protocol of the compensating cathodes. Regarding these
                 main stimulation electrodes, the stimulation protocol
                 was most sensitive to uncertainty in skull
                 conductivity. Finally, the probability that the current
                 density amplitude in the auditory cortex target region
                 is supra-threshold was below 50{\%}. SIGNIFICANCE: The
                 results suggest that an uncertain conductivity profile
                 in computational models of tDCS can have a substantial
                 influence on the prediction of optimal stimulation
                 protocols for stimulation of the auditory cortex. The
                 investigations carried out in this study present a
                 possibility to predict the probability of providing a
                 therapeutic effect with an optimized electrode system
                 for future auditory clinical and experimental
                 procedures of tDCS applications.",

                 indications for an implantable
                 cardioverter-defibrillator. Programming was
                 standardized into 3 zones: (1) ventricular fibrillation

                 within the VF zone (CL, 200 to 250 ms) treated with 2
                 ATP bursts, LES, and HES; and (3) fast ventricular
                 tachycardia (CL, 251 to 320 ms) and slow VT (CL, >320
                 ms) treated with 3 ATP bursts, LES, and HES. The
                 primary end point was ATP and LES efficacy and safety.
                 After a mean follow-up of 19 +/- 8 months, 2,815 device
                 activations were recorded in 152 patients. Of 67 VFVT

                 contact with biological tissues, the induced current
                 density has strong singularity along the periphery of
                 the electrode, which may cause painful sensation or
                 burn. Especially in impedance imaging methods such as
                 the magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography,
                 we should avoid such singularity since more uniform
                 current density underneath a current-injection
                 electrode is desirable. In this paper, we study an
                 optimal geometry of a recessed electrode to produce a
                 well-distributed current density on the contact area
                 under the electrode. We investigate the geometry of the
                 electrode surface to minimize the edge singularity and
                 produce nearly uniform current density on the contact
                 area. We propose a mathematical framework for the
                 uniform current density electrode and its optimal
                 geometry. The theoretical results are supported by
                 numerical simulations.",

                 causes of death in the Western world. According to one
                 hypothesis, the chaotic excitation dynamics during VF
                 are the result of dynamical instabilities in action
                 potential duration (APD) the occurrence of which
                 requires that the slope of the APD restitution curve
                 exceeds 1. Other factors such as electrotonic coupling
                 and cardiac memory also determine whether these
                 instabilities can develop. In this paper we study the
                 conditions for alternans and spiral breakup in human
                 cardiac tissue. Therefore, we develop a new version of
                 our human ventricular cell model, which is based on
                 recent experimental measurements of human APD
                 restitution and includes a more extensive description
                 of intracellular calcium dynamics. We apply this model
                 to study the conditions for electrical instability in
                 single cells, for reentrant waves in a ring of cells,
                 and for reentry in two-dimensional sheets of
                 ventricular tissue. We show that an important
                 determinant for the onset of instability is the
                 recovery dynamics of the fast sodium current. Slower
                 sodium current recovery leads to longer periods of
                 spiral wave rotation and more gradual conduction
                 velocity restitution, both of which suppress
                 restitution-mediated instability. As a result, maximum
                 restitution slopes considerably exceeding 1 (up to 1.5)
                 may be necessary for electrical instability to occur.
                 Although slopes necessary for the onset of
                 instabilities found in our study exceed 1, they are
                 within the range of experimentally measured slopes.
                 Therefore, we conclude that steep APD
                 restitution-mediated instability is a potential
                 mechanism for VF in the human heart.",

                 incidence of approximately 3\%, of which more than 50\%
                 of the cases are due to ventricular fibrillation.
                 Electrical defibrillation is the most effective therapy
                 for terminating cardiac arrhythmias associated with
                 unstable hemodynamics. The excitation threshold of
                 myocardial microstructures is lower when external
                 electrical fields are applied in the longitudinal
                 direction with respect to the major axis of cells.
                 However, in the heart, cell bundles are disposed in
                 several directions. Improved myocardial excitation and
                 defibrillation have been achieved by applying shocks in
                 multiple directions via intracardiac leads, but the
                 results are controversial when the electrodes are not
                 located within the cardiac chambers. This study was
                 designed to test whether rapidly switching shock
                 delivery in 3 directions could increase the efficiency
                 of direct defibrillation. METHODS: A multidirectional
                 defibrillator and paddles bearing 3 electrodes each
                 were developed and used in vivo for the reversal of
                 electrically induced ventricular fibrillation in an
                 anesthetized open-chest swine model. Direct
                 defibrillation was performed by unidirectional and
                 multidirectional shocks applied in an alternating
                 fashion. Survival analysis was used to estimate the
                 relationship between the probability of defibrillation
                 and the shock energy. RESULTS: Compared with shock
                 delivery in a single direction in the same animal
                 population, the shock energy required for
                 multidirectional defibrillation was 20\% to 30\% lower
                 (P < .05) within a wide range of success probabilities.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly switching multidirectional shock
                 delivery required lower shock energy for ventricular
                 fibrillation termination and may be a safer alternative
                 for restoring cardiac sinus rhythm.",

  abstract =     "Characterizing the performance of image segmentation
                 approaches has been a persistent challenge. Performance
                 analysis is important since segmentation algorithms
                 often have limited accuracy and precision. Interactive
                 drawing of the desired segmentation by human raters has
                 often been the only acceptable approach, and yet
                 suffers from intra-rater and inter-rater variability.
                 Automated algorithms have been sought in order to
                 remove the variability introduced by raters, but such
                 algorithms must be assessed to ensure they are suitable
                 for the task. The performance of raters (human or
                 algorithmic) generating segmentations of medical images
                 has been difficult to quantify because of the
                 difficulty of obtaining or estimating a known true
                 segmentation for clinical data. Although physical and
                 digital phantoms can be constructed for which ground
                 truth is known or readily estimated, such phantoms do
                 not fully reflect clinical images due to the difficulty
                 of constructing phantoms which reproduce the full range
                 of imaging characteristics and normal and pathological
                 anatomical variability observed in clinical data.
                 Comparison to a collection of segmentations by raters
                 is an attractive alternative since it can be carried
                 out directly on the relevant clinical imaging data.
                 However, the most appropriate measure or set of
                 measures with which to compare such segmentations has
                 not been clarified and several measures are used in
                 practice. We present here an expectation-maximization
                 algorithm for simultaneous truth and performance level
                 estimation (STAPLE). The algorithm considers a
                 collection of segmentations and computes a
                 probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation and a
                 measure of the performance level represented by each
                 segmentation. The source of each segmentation in the
                 collection may be an appropriately trained human rater
                 or raters, or may be an automated segmentation
                 algorithm. The probabilistic estimate of the true
                 segmentation is formed by estimating an optimal
                 combination of the segmentations, weighting each
                 segmentation depending upon the estimated performance
                 level, and incorporating a prior model for the spatial
                 distribution of structures being segmented as well as
                 spatial homogeneity constraints. STAPLE is
                 straightforward to apply to clinical imaging data, it
                 readily enables assessment of the performance of an
                 automated image segmentation algorithm, and enables
                 direct comparison of human rater and algorithm

                 frequency alternating current (HFAC) electric fields
                 can reversibly block propagation in the heart by
                 inducing an oscillating, elevated transmembrane
                 potential (Vm) that maintains myocytes in a refractory
                 state for the field duration and can terminate
                 arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation (VF).
                 OBJECTIVES: To quantify and characterize conduction
                 block (CB) induced by HFAC fields and to determine
                 whether the degree of CB can be used to predict
                 defibrillation success. METHODS: Optical mapping was
                 performed in adult guinea pig hearts (n = 14), and
                 simulations were performed in an anatomically accurate
                 rabbit ventricular model. HFAC fields (50-500 Hz) were
                 applied to the ventricles. A novel power spectrum
                 metric of CB-the loss of spectral power in the 1-30 Hz
                 range, termed loss of conduction power (LCP)-was
                 assessed during the HFAC field and compared with
                 defibrillation success and VF vulnerability. RESULTS:
                 LCP increased with field strength and decreased with
                 frequency. Optical mapping experiments conducted on the
                 epicardial surface showed that LCP and the size of CB
                 regions were significantly correlated with VF
                 initiation and termination. In simulations, subsurface
                 myocardial LCP and CB sizes were more closely
                 correlated with VF termination than surface values.
                 Multilinear regression analysis of simulation results
                 revealed that while CB on both the surface and the
                 subsurface myocardium was predictive, subsurface
                 myocardial CB was the better predictor of
                 defibrillation success. CONCLUSIONS: HFAC fields induce
                 a field-dependent state of CB, and defibrillation
                 success is related to the degree and location of the
                 CB.",

                 hospitals or by outpatient emergency medical services
                 (EMS) personnel can save many cardiac-arrest victims.
                 Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) permit
                 defibrillation by trained first responders and
                 laypersons. AEDs are available at most public venues,
                 and vast sums of money are spent installing and
                 maintaining these devices. AEDs have been evaluated in
                 a variety of public and private settings. AEDs
                 accurately identify malignant ventricular
                 tachyarrhythmias and frequently result in successful
                 defibrillation. Prompt application of an AED shows a
                 greater number of patients in VF compared with initial
                 rhythms documented by later-arriving EMS personnel.
                 Survival is greatest when the AED is placed within 3 to
                 5 minutes of a witnessed collapse. Community-based
                 studies show increased cardiac-arrest survival when
                 first responders are equipped with AEDs rather than
                 waiting for paramedics to defibrillate. Wide
                 dissemination of AEDs throughout a community increases
                 survival from cardiac arrest when the AED is used;
                 however, the AEDs are utilized in a very small
                 percentage of all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. AEDs
                 save very few lives in residential units such as
                 private homes or apartment complexes. AEDs are cost
                 effective at sites where there is a high density of
                 both potential victims and resuscitators. Placement at
                 golf courses, health clubs, and similar venues is not
                 cost effective; however, the visible devices are good
                 for public awareness of the problem of sudden cardiac

                 function. From detailed histological studies and
                 diffusion tensor imaging, we now know that fibre
                 orientations in humans vary gradually from
                 approximately -70 degrees in the outer wall to +80
                 degrees in the inner wall. However, the creation of
                 fibre orientation maps for computational analyses
                 remains one of the most challenging problems in cardiac
                 electrophysiology and cardiac mechanics. Here, we show
                 that Poisson interpolation generates smoothly varying
                 vector fields that satisfy a set of user-defined
                 constraints in arbitrary domains. Specifically, we
                 enforce the Poisson interpolation in the weak sense
                 using a standard linear finite element algorithm for
                 scalar-valued second-order boundary value problems and
                 introduce the feature to be interpolated as a global
                 unknown. User-defined constraints are then simply
                 enforced in the strong sense as Dirichlet boundary
                 conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed concept is
                 capable of generating smoothly varying fibre
                 orientations, quickly, efficiently and robustly, both
                 in a generic bi-ventricular model and in a
                 patient-specific human heart. Sensitivity analyses
                 demonstrate that the underlying algorithm is
                 conceptually able to handle both arbitrarily and
                 uniformly distributed user-defined constraints;
                 however, the quality of the interpolation is best for
                 uniformly distributed constraints. We anticipate our
                 algorithm to be immediately transformative to
                 experimental and clinical settings, in which it will
                 allow us to quickly and reliably create smooth

                 rats. Precordial compression was begun together with
                 mechanical ventilation after 4 minutes of untreated VF
                 and continued for 6 minutes. Spontaneous circulation
                 was restored in each animal after external
                 defibrillation with a single stored 2-, 10-, or 20-J
                 countershock. Cardiac index and the rate of left
                 ventricular pressure rise at left ventricular pressure
                 of 40 mm Hg (dP/dt40) and fall (negative dP/dt) during
                 the 240-minute interval after successful resuscitation
                 were decreased, and left ventricular diastolic pressure
                 was increased. These decreases in myocardial function
                 were closely related to the energy of electrical
                 defibrillation. After a 20-J shock, animals survived
                 for only 5{+/-}3 hours; after a 10-J shock, animals
                 survived for 15{+/-}4 hours; and after a 2-J shock, all
                 animals survived for >24 hours. Conclusions The
                 severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is
                 related, at least in part, to the magnitude of the
                 electrical energy of the delivered shock.",

  abstract =     "The presence, size, and distribution of ischemic
                 tissue bear significant prognostic and therapeutic
                 implication for ventricular arrhythmias. While many
                 approaches to 3D infarct detection have been developed
                 via electrophysiological (EP) imaging from noninvasive
                 electrocardiographic data, this ill-posed inverse
                 problem remains challenging especially for septal
                 infarcts that are hidden from body-surface data. We
                 propose a variational Bayesian framework for EP imaging
                 of 3D infarct using a total-variation prior. The
                 posterior distribution of intramural action potential
                 and all regularization parameters are estimated from
                 body-surface data by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler
                 divergence. Because of the uncertainty introduced in
                 prior models, we hypothesize that the solution
                 uncertainty plays as important a role as the point
                 estimate in interpreting the reconstruction. This is
                 verified in a set of phantom and real-data experiments,
                 where regions of low confidence help to eliminate
                 false-positives and to accurately identify infarcts of
                 various locations (including septum) and distributions.
                 Owing to the ability of total-variation prior in
                 extracting the boundary between smooth regions, the
                 presented method also has the potential to outline
                 infarct border that is the most critical region
                 responsible for ventricular arrhvthmias.",
