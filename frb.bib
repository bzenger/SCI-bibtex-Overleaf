                 in order to characterize and test newly constructed
                 electrodes in an acute environment, and their
                 properties and performance need to be evaluated in
                 long-term, chronic implantations. Owing to their
                 availability, small size and neuroanatomical similarity
                 to the human brain, minipigs are frequently used for
                 neurological studies. Despite this fact, there are
                 still no standardized experimental and neurosurgical
                 procedures available for recording of cortical
                 potentials using implantable {BMI} electrodes in
                 minipigs, and, until now, it was unclear whether these
                 animals could also be used for long-term subdural
                 electrode implantations. We have therefore evaluated
                 the potential use of minipigs for acute and chronic

                 the minipig's cerebral cortex. A neurophysiological
                 setup is described which is suitable to perform
                 recordings of somatosensory evoked potentials ({SEPs})

                 placement are discussed and common surgical pitfalls

                 for brain disorders, and thus great efforts are being
                 made to develop devices for long-term application.
                 Closed-loop interaction can be implemented using
                 electrophysiological recording techniques, and can be
                 used to modulate local cortical activity or long-range
                 functional connectivity. In a case study performed in
                 sheep chronically implanted with a novel
                 micro-electrocorticography-based device, we show that
                 (1) open-loop single-pulse electrical stimulation
                 ({SPES}) elicited the well-known cortico-cortical
                 evoked potentials ({CCEPs}), and (2) closed-loop
                 repetitive-pulse electrical stimulation ({RPES})
                 elicited specific cortico-cortical spectral responses
                 ({CCSRs}). {CCSRs} were spatially focalized in the
                 gamma band, compared with beta band independent of
                 {RPES} frequency. The topography of {CCSRs} was
                 different compared with {CCEPs}, suggesting that
                 {CCEPs} and {CCSRs} capture different aspects of
                 cortico-cortical connectivity. We propose that {CCSRs}
                 provide new useful measures of functional connectivity,
                 and that in particular gamma-band {CCSRs} may be an
                 optimal choice if spatially precise closed-loop
                 interaction is desired. However, the parameter space of
                 micro-electrocorticography stimulation patterns and
                 associated changes in ?{ECoG} frequency bands needs to
                 be further explored and many questions remain before
