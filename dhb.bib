                 necessity to operate a joint processing of simultaneous
                 magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography
                 (EEG) recordings for functional brain imaging has never
                 been clearly demonstrated. However, the very last
                 generation of MEG instruments allows the simultaneous
                 recording of brain magnetic fields and electrical
                 potentials on the scalp. But the general fear regarding
                 the fusion between MEG and EEG data is that the
                 drawbacks from one modality will systematically spoil
                 the performances of the other one without any
                 consequent improvement. This is the case for instance
                 for the estimation of deeper or radial sources with
                 MEG. In this paper, the authors propose a method for a
                 cooperative processing of MEG and EEG in a distributed
                 source model. First, the evaluation of the respective
                 performances of each modality for the estimation of
                 every dipole in the source pattern is made using a
                 conditional entropy criterion. Then, the algorithm
                 operates a preprocessing of the MEG and EEG gain
                 matrices which minimizes the mutual information between
                 these two transfer functions, by a selective weighting
                 of the MEG and EEG lead fields. This new combined
                 EEG/MEG modality brings major improvements to the
                 localization of active sources, together with reduced
                 sensitivity to perturbations on data",

                 suited to the analysis of event-related data. Results

                 (MEG) arrays, which allow for spatially correlated
                 noise between sensors with unknown covariance. The
                 electric source is modeled as a collection of current
                 dipoles at fixed locations and the head as a spherical
                 conductor. We permit the dipoles' moments to vary with
                 time by modeling them as linear combinations of
                 parametric or nonparametric basis functions. We
                 estimate the dipoles' locations and moments and derive
                 the Cramer-Rao bound for the unknown parameters. We
                 also propose an ML based method for scanning the brain

                 multidimensional search required to obtain the true
                 dipole location estimates. Numerical simulations

                 onset zone estimated from ictal recordings with high
                 spatial resolution, 256-channel scalp dense array
                 electroencephalographic video long-term monitoring
                 (LTM) with the aid of source analysis with that
                 obtained from subsequent intracranial ictal recordings.
                 METHODS: Ten patients with medically refractory
                 epilepsy, all surgical candidates, underwent
                 intracranial LTM after standard noninvasive evaluation
                 failed to provide adequate localizing information
                 regarding ictal origins. Before invasive studies, all
                 patients underwent dense array electroencephalographic
                 LTM in which habitual clinical seizures were recorded
                 for each patient. Source analysis was applied to ictal
                 onsets. Intracranial electrode placement followed
                 conventional guidelines, although the neurosurgeon was
                 aware of the dense array electroencephalographic
                 results. Patients ranged in age from 10 to 49 years
                 (mean age, 24 y); 7 were male. Identified risk factors
                 included closed head injury in 1 patient and childhood
                 meningitis in another. No focal neurological signs were
                 found in any patient. Magnetic resonance imaging
                 findings were normal in 6 patients; 1 patient had
                 cerebellar hypoplasia, 1 had right frontoparietal
                 dysplasia, 1 had bilateral nonspecific white matter
                 abnormalities, and 1 had bilateral cavernous angiomas.
                 RESULTS: Ictal onsets, based on invasive recordings,
                 were in the mesiotemporal lobe (3 patients),
                 lateroparietal (2 patients), mesioparietal (1 patient),
                 laterofrontal (1 patient), superolateral frontocentral
                 (1 patient), frontopolar (1 patient), and
                 posteroinferior temporo-occipital neocortex (1
                 patient). Dense array electroencephalography localized
                 ictal onsets to the same region as intracranial
                 monitoring in 8 of 10 cases; invasive studies disclosed
                 an additional ictal focus in 2 of these patients.
                 Surgical resections were based only on intracranial
                 electroencephalographic findings. CONCLUSION: Dense
                 array electroencephalography has the potential to
                 assist in the noninvasive localization of epileptic
                 seizures and to guide the placement of invasive
                 electrodes for localizing seizure onset.",

                 cerebral cortex activated during the onset and
                 propagation of dense array electroencephalographic
                 (dEEG) epileptiform discharges in patients with
                 juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), through the use of
                 256 channel, dense array scalp EEG recordings. Ten
                 patients (16-58 years old) with the clinical diagnosis
                 of JME comprised the study group. In all cases the MRI
                 and neurological exams were normal, while standard EEG
                 recordings documented typical generalized 4-6 Hz
                 epileptiform patterns. Outpatient dEEG recordings
                 captured epileptiform discharges in each patient.
                 Localization of onset and spread of discharges in
                 relation to a standard MRI model was accomplished by
                 applying dipole fits and a distributed linear inverse
                 method of cortically constrained source analysis. All
                 patients showed epileptiform discharges that localized
                 to sources that included orbitofrontal/medial
                 frontopolar cortex, while basal-medial temporal lobe
                 sources were observed in 5/10 subjects. In many ways
                 similar to discharges of typical absence, epileptiform
                 patterns in JME are usually irregular and frequently
                 include temporal lobe structures as the dominant
                 contributors to the discharges. We find that
                 epileptiform discharges in patients with JME are not
                 generalized in the sense of bilaterally synchronous
                 diffuse onset. Rather, discharges have both localized
                 onsets and a restricted cortical network during
                 propagation that includes regions of frontal and
                 temporal cortex.",

                 proved invaluable in identifying structural brain
                 lesions in patients with epilepsy. The assumption that
                 such focal lesions invariably predict the site of
                 seizure origin may not be correct, however. We report a
                 series of 20 adults with medically intractable partial
                 epilepsy, where high-resolution brain MRI disclosed a
                 unilateral, focal, hippocampal, or neocortical lesion
                 as the only abnormality in each case; nevertheless,
                 based on electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings,
                 ictal onsets arose from a completely different location
                 than that of the MRI lesion. All patients underwent
                 epilepsy surgery, with the operations based on ictal
                 EEG findings, and all were followed at least 2 years
                 after the resection. After the most recent follow-up
                 examination, 50\% (10/20) of the patients were
                 completely seizure-free, 35\% (7/20) had at least a
                 75\% reduction in the number of seizures, and 15\%
                 (3/20) had less than a 75\% reduction in the number of
                 seizures. We conclude that the identification of a
                 focal, structural, hippocampal, or neocortical lesion
                 on brain MRI is not always indicative of the site of
                 seizure origin in partial epilepsy. Furthermore, in
                 cases of discordance between MRI and EEG data, a good
                 outcome after epilepsy surgery is possible if EEG ictal
                 onsets are definitive.",

  abstract =     "Computing epicardial potentials from body surface
                 potentials constitutes one form of ill-posed inverse
                 problem of electrocardiography (ECG). To solve this ECG
                 inverse problem, the Tikhonov regularization and
                 truncated singular-value decomposition (TSVD) methods
                 have been commonly used to overcome the ill-posed
                 property by imposing constraints on the magnitudes or
                 derivatives of the computed epicardial potentials. Such
                 direct regularization methods, however, are impractical
                 when the transfer matrix is large. The least-squares QR
                 (LSQR) method, one of the iterative regularization
                 methods based on Lanczos bidiagonalization and QR
                 factorization, has been shown to be numerically more
                 reliable in various circumstances than the other
                 methods considered. This LSQR method, however, to our
                 knowledge, has not been introduced and investigated for
                 the ECG inverse problem. In this paper, the
                 regularization properties of the Krylov subspace
                 iterative method of LSQR for solving the ECG inverse
                 problem were investigated. Due to the
                 'semi-convergence' property of the LSQR method, the
                 L-curve method was used to determine the stopping
                 iteration number. The performance of the LSQR method
                 for solving the ECG inverse problem was also evaluated
                 based on a realistic heart-torso model simulation
                 protocol. The results show that the inverse solutions
                 recovered by the LSQR method were more accurate than
                 those recovered by the Tikhonov and TSVD methods. In
                 addition, by combing the LSQR with genetic algorithms
                 (GA), the performance can be improved further. It
                 suggests that their combination may provide a good
                 scheme for solving the ECG inverse problem.",

  abstract =     "In this paper, two hybrid regularization frameworks,
                 LSQR-Tik and Tik-LSQR, which integrate the properties
                 of the direct regularization method (Tikhonov) and the
                 iterative regularization method (LSQR), have been
                 proposed and investigated for solving ECG inverse
                 problems. The LSQR-Tik method is based on the Lanczos
                 process, which yields a sequence of small bidiagonal
                 systems to approximate the original ill-posed problem
                 and then the Tikhonov regularization method is applied
                 to stabilize the projected problem. The Tik-LSQR method
                 is formulated as an iterative LSQR inverse, augmented
                 with a Tikhonov-like prior information term. The
                 performances of these two hybrid methods are evaluated
                 using a realistic heart-torso model simulation
                 protocol, in which the heart surface source method is
                 employed to calculate the simulated epicardial
                 potentials (EPs) from the action potentials (APs), and
                 then the acquired EPs are used to calculate simulated
                 body surface potentials (BSPs). The results show that
                 the regularized solutions obtained by the LSQR-Tik
                 method are approximate to those of the Tikhonov method,
                 the computational cost of the LSQR-Tik method, however,
                 is much less than that of the Tikhonov method.
                 Moreover, the Tik-LSQR scheme can reconstruct the
                 epcicardial potential distribution more accurately,
                 specifically for the BSPs with large noisy cases. This
                 investigation suggests that hybrid regularization
                 methods may be more effective than separate
                 regularization approaches for ECG inverse problems.",

                 important component of any method for computing the
                 spatio-temporal activity of the neural sources of
                 magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography
                 (EEG) data. The forward problem involves computing the
                 scalp potentials or external magnetic field at a finite
                 set of sensor locations for a putative source
                 configuration. We present a unified treatment of
                 analytical and numerical solutions of the forward
                 problem in a form suitable for use in inverse methods.
                 This formulation is achieved through factorization of
                 the lead field into the product of the moment of the
                 elemental current dipole source with a kernel matrix
                 that depends on the head geometry and source and sensor
                 locations, and a sensor matrix that models sensor
                 orientation and gradiometer effects in MEG and
                 differential measurements in EEG. Using this
                 formulation and a recently developed approximation
                 formula for EEG, based on the Berg parameters, we
                 present novel reformulations of the basic EEG and MEG
                 kernels that dispel the myth that EEG is inherently
                 more complicated to calculate than MEG. We also present
                 novel investigations of different boundary element
                 methods (BEMs) and present evidence that improvements
                 over currently published BEM methods can be realized
                 using alternative error-weighting methods. Explicit
                 expressions for the matrix kernels for MEG and EEG for
                 spherical and realistic head geometries are included",

  abstract =     "Synchronized moving aperture radiation therapy (SMART)
                 is a new technique for treating mobile tumours under
                 development at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).
                 The basic idea of SMART is to synchronize the moving
                 radiation beam aperture formed by a dynamic multileaf
                 collimator (DMLC) with the tumour motion induced by
                 respiration. SMART is based on the concept of the
                 average tumour trajectory (ATT) exhibited by a tumour
                 during respiration. During the treatment simulation
                 stage, tumour motion is measured and the ATT is
                 derived. Then, the original IMRT MLC leaf sequence is
                 modified using the ATT to compensate for tumour motion.
                 During treatment, the tumour motion is monitored. The
                 treatment starts when leaf motion and tumour motion are
                 synchronized at a specific breathing phase. The
                 treatment will halt when the tumour drifts away from
                 the ATT and will resume when the synchronization
                 between tumour motion and radiation beam is
                 re-established. In this paper, we present a method to
                 derive the ATT from measured tumour trajectory data. We
                 also investigate the validity of the ATT concept for
                 lung tumours during normal breathing. The lung tumour
                 trajectory data were acquired during actual
                 radiotherapy sessions using a real-time tumour-tracking
                 system. SMART treatment is simulated by assuming that
                 the radiation beam follows the derived ATT and the
                 tumour follows the measured trajectory. In simulation,
                 the treatment starts at exhale phase. The duty cycle of
                 SMART delivery was calculated for various treatment
                 times and gating thresholds, as well as for various
                 exhale phases where the treatment begins. The
                 simulation results show that in the case of free
                 breathing, for 4 out of 11 lung datasets with tumour
                 motion greater than 1 cm from peak to peak, the error
                 in tumour tracking can be controlled to within a couple
                 of millimetres while maintaining a reasonable delivery
                 efficiency. That is to say, without any breath
                 coaching/control, the ATT is a valid concept for some
                 lung tumours. However, to make SMART an efficient
                 technique in general, it is found that breath coaching
                 techniques are required.",

  abstract =     "It is important to monitor tumor movement during
                 radiotherapy. Respiration-induced motion affects tumors
                 in the thorax and abdomen (in particular, those located
                 in the lung region). For image-guided radiotherapy
                 (IGRT) systems, it is desirable to minimize imaging
                 dose, so external surrogates are used to infer the
                 internal tumor motion between image acquisitions. This
                 process relies on consistent correspondence between the
                 external surrogate signal and the internal tumor
                 motion. Respiratory hysteresis complicates the
                 external/internal correspondence because two distinct
                 tumor positions during different breathing phases can
                 yield the same external observation. Previous attempts
                 to resolve this ambiguity often subdivided the data
                 into inhale/exhale stages and restricted the estimation
                 to only one of these directions. In this study, we
                 propose a new approach to infer the internal tumor
                 motion from external surrogate signal using state
                 augmentation. This method resolves the hysteresis
                 ambiguity by incorporating higher-order system
                 dynamics. It circumvents the segmentation of the
                 internal/external trajectory into different phases, and
                 estimates the inference map based on all the available
                 external/internal correspondence pairs. Optimization of
                 the state augmentation is investigated. This method
                 generalizes naturally to adaptive on-line algorithms.",

                 important to locate the tumor position in real time
                 during treatment. However, respiration-induced tumor
                 motions are difficult to track. They are semi-periodic
                 and exhibit variations in baseline, frequency and
                 fundamental pattern (oscillatory amplitude and shape).
                 In this study, we try to decompose the above-mentioned
                 components from discrete observations in real time.
                 Baseline drift, frequency (equivalently phase)
                 variation and fundamental pattern change characterize
                 different aspects of respiratory motion and have
                 distinctive clinical indications. Furthermore,
                 smoothness is a valid assumption for each one of these
                 components in their own spaces, and facilitates
                 effective extrapolation for the purpose of estimation
                 and prediction. We call this process 'profiling' to
                 reflect the integration of information extraction,
                 decomposition, processing and recovery. The proposed
                 method has three major ingredients: (1) real-time
                 baseline and phase estimation based on elliptical shape
                 tracking in augmented state space and Poincare
                 sectioning principle; (2) estimation of the fundamental
                 pattern by unwarping the observation with phase
                 estimate from the previous step; (3) filtering of
                 individual components and assembly in the original
                 temporal-displacement signal space. We tested the
                 proposed method with both simulated and clinical data.
                 For the purpose of prediction, the results are
                 comparable to what one would expect from a human
                 operator. The proposed approach is fully unsupervised
                 and data driven, making it ideal for applications
                 requiring economy, efficiency and flexibility.",

                 model in forward and inverse electroencephalography and
                 magnetoencephalography applications. Analytic solutions
                 to the governing field equations have been developed
                 for several approximations of the human head using
                 ideal dipoles as the source model. Numeric approaches
                 such as the finite-element and finite-difference
                 methods have become popular because they allow the use
                 of anatomically realistic head models and the increased
                 computational power that they require has become
                 readily available. Although numeric methods can
                 represent more realistic domains, the sources in such
                 models are an approximation of the ideal dipole. In
                 this paper, we examine several methods for representing
                 dipole sources in finite-element models and compare the
                 resulting surface potentials and external magnetic
                 field with those obtained from analytic solutions using

                 radiosurgery offers the potential for precise radiation
                 dose delivery to a moving tumour. Recent work has
                 demonstrated how to locate and track the position of a
                 tumour in real-time using diagnostic x-ray imaging to
                 find implanted radio-opaque markers. However, the
                 delivery of a treatment plan through gating or beam
                 tracking requires adequate consideration of treatment
                 system latencies, including image acquisition, image
                 processing, communication delays, control system
                 processing, inductance within the motor, mechanical
                 damping, etc. Furthermore, the imaging dose given over
                 long radiosurgery procedures or multiple radiotherapy
                 fractions may not be insignificant, which means that we
                 must reduce the sampling rate of the imaging system.
                 This study evaluates various predictive models for
                 reducing tumour localization errors when a real-time
                 tumour-tracking system targets a moving tumour at a
                 slow imaging rate and with large system latencies. We
                 consider 14 lung tumour cases where the peak-to-peak
                 motion is greater than 8 mm, and compare the
                 localization error using linear prediction, neural
                 network prediction and Kalman filtering, against a
                 system which uses no prediction. To evaluate prediction
                 accuracy for use in beam tracking, we compute the root
                 mean squared error between predicted and actual 3D
                 motion. We found that by using prediction, root mean
                 squared error is improved for all latencies and all
                 imaging rates evaluated. To evaluate prediction
                 accuracy for use in gated treatment, we present a new
                 metric that compares a gating control signal based on
                 predicted motion against the best possible gating
                 control signal. We found that using prediction improves
                 gated treatment accuracy for systems that have
                 latencies of 200 ms or greater, and for systems that
                 have imaging rates of 10 Hz or slower.",

                 tissue, but the generation of seizures typically
                 involves propagation of abnormal activity through
                 cerebral networks. We examined epileptiform discharges
                 (spikes) with dense array electroencephalography (dEEG)
                 in five patients to search for the possible engagement
                 of pathological networks. Source analysis was conducted
                 with individual electrical head models for each
                 patient, including sensor position measurement for
                 registration with MRI with geodesic photogrammetry;
                 tissue segmentation and skull conductivity modeling
                 with an atlas skull warped to each patient's MRI;
                 cortical surface extraction and tessellation into 1
                 cm(2) equivalent dipole patches; inverse source
                 estimation with either minimum norm or cortical surface
                 Laplacian constraints; and spectral coherence computed
                 among equivalent dipoles aggregated within Brodmann
                 areas with 1 Hz resolution from 1 to 70 Hz. These
                 analyses revealed characteristic source coherence
                 patterns in each patient during the pre-spike, spike,
                 and post-spike intervals. For one patient with both
                 spikes and seizure onset localized to a single temporal
                 lobe, we observed a cluster of apparently abnormal
                 coherences over the involved temporal lobe. For the
                 other patients, there were apparently characteristic
                 coherence patterns associated with the discharges, and
                 in some cases these appeared to reflect abnormal
                 temporal lobe synchronization, but the coherence
                 patterns for these patients were not easily related to
                 an unequivocal epileptogenic zone. In contrast, simple
                 localization of the site of onset of the spike
                 discharge, and/or the site of onset of the seizure,
                 with non-invasive 256 dEEG was useful in predicting the
                 characteristic site of seizure onset for those cases
                 that were verified by intracranial EEG and/or by
                 surgical outcome.",

                 observed to emerge from cortical slow oscillations
                 (CSOs) and spindles in sleep. We examined a patient's
                 generalized SW seizures that appeared to emerge from
                 CSOs in sleep. METHODS: Dense array (256-channel)
                 electroencephalographic (dEEG) data were recorded
                 during long-term monitoring for localizing seizure
                 onset for neurosurgical planning. CSOs were identified
                 on the basis of topographic criteria from dEEG studies
                 of normal human sleep. SW discharges were identified in
                 the surface dEEG and examined with distributed linear
                 inverse neural source estimation. RESULTS: This
                 patient's SW discharges appeared to emerge from a
                 series of CSOs that engaged the left frontal pole.
                 Furthermore, 12Hz sleep spindles in this patient were
                 often synchronized in time with the CSOs, and in some
                 instances they shared a similar localization over the
                 left frontal pole at the point of seizure onset.
                 CONCLUSIONS: The initial discharges of each seizure
                 engaged both the left frontal pole, which was the
                 primary neural source of this patient's CSOs, and the
                 left temporal lobe, which seemed critical for the
                 evolution of this patient's seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: The
                 correlation of SW seizures with CSOs in animal studies
                 may be observed in humans as well, providing clues to
                 the pathology of arousal regulation in some cases of
                 nocturnal epilepsy.",

  abstract =     "Effective image guided radiation treatment of a moving
                 tumour requires adequate information on respiratory
                 motion characteristics. For margin expansion, beam
                 tracking and respiratory gating, the tumour motion must
                 be quantified for pretreatment planning and monitored
                 on-line. We propose a finite state model for
                 respiratory motion analysis that captures our natural
                 understanding of breathing stages. In this model, a
                 regular breathing cycle is represented by three line
                 segments, exhale, end-of-exhale and inhale, while
                 abnormal breathing is represented by an irregular
                 breathing state. In addition, we describe an on-line
                 implementation of this model in one dimension. We found
                 this model can accurately characterize a wide variety
                 of patient breathing patterns. This model was used to
                 describe the respiratory motion for 23 patients with
                 peak-to-peak motion greater than 7 mm. The average root
                 mean square error over all patients was less than 1 mm
                 and no patient has an error worse than 1.5 mm. Our
                 model provides a convenient tool to quantify
                 respiratory motion characteristics, such as patterns of
                 frequency changes and amplitude changes, and can be
                 applied to internal or external motion, including
                 internal tumour position, abdominal surface, diaphragm,
                 spirometry and other surrogates.",
