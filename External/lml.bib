  abstract =     "Long-term synaptic plasticity leading to enhancement
                 in synaptic efficacy (long-term potentiation, LTP) or
                 decrease in synaptic efficacy (long-term depression,
                 LTD) is widely regarded as underlying learning and
                 memory in nervous systems. LTP and LTD at excitatory
                 neuronal synapses are observed to be induced by precise
                 timing of pre- and postsynaptic events. Modification of
                 synaptic transmission in long-term plasticity is a
                 complex process involving many pathways; for example,
                 it is also known that both forms of synaptic plasticity
                 can be induced by various time courses of Ca2+
                 introduction into the postsynaptic cell. We present a
                 phenomenological description of a two-component process
                 for synaptic plasticity. Our dynamical model reproduces
                 the spike time-dependent plasticity of excitatory
                 synapses as a function of relative timing between pre-
                 and postsynaptic events, as observed in recent
                 experiments. The model accounts for LTP and LTD when
                 the postsynaptic cell is voltage clamped and
                 depolarized (LTP) or hyperpolarized (LTD) and no
                 postsynaptic action potentials are evoked. We are also
                 able to connect our model with the Bienenstock, Cooper,
                 and Munro rule. We give model predictions for changes
                 in synaptic strength when periodic spike trains of
                 varying frequency and Poisson distributed spike trains
                 with varying average frequency are presented pre- and
                 postsynaptically. When the frequency of spike
                 presentation exceeds[approx] 30-40 Hz, only LTP is
                 induced.",

                 ventricular myocytes where the diffusion distance of
                 Ca2+ was limited to < 50 nm by dialysis with high
                 concentrations of Ca2+ buffers. Dialysis of the cell
                 with 2 mM Ca(2+)- indicator dye, Fura-2, or 2 mM Fura-2
                 plus 14 mM EGTA decreased the magnitude of
                 ICa-triggered intracellular Ca2+ transients
                 (Cai-transients) from 500 to 20-100 nM and completely
                 abolished contraction, even though the amount of Ca2+
                 released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum remained
                 constant (approximately 140 microM). Inactivation
                 kinetics of ICa in highly Ca(2+)-buffered cells was
                 retarded when Ca2+ stores of the sarcoplasmic reticulum
                 (SR) were depleted by caffeine applied 500 ms before
                 activation of ICa, while inactivation was accelerated
                 if caffeine-induced release coincided with the
                 activation of ICa. Quantitative analysis of these data
                 indicate that the rate of inactivation of ICa was
                 linearly related to SR Ca(2+)-release and reduced by >
                 67\% when release was absent. Thapsigargin, abolishing
                 SR release, suppressed the effect of caffeine on the
                 inactivation kinetics of ICa. Caffeine-triggered
                 Ca(2+)-release, in the absence of Ca2+ entry through
                 the Ca2+ channel (using Ba2+ as a charge carrier),
                 caused rapid inactivation of the slowly decaying Ba2+
                 current. Since Ba2+ does not release Ca2+ but binds to
                 Fura-2, it was possible to calibrate the fluorescence
                 signals in terms of equivalent cation charge. Using
                 this procedure, the amplification factor of ICa-induced
                 Ca2+ release was found to be 17.6 +/- 1.1 (n = 4). The
                 Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange current, activated by
                 caffeine-induced Ca2+ release, was measured
                 consistently in myocytes dialyzed with 0.2 but not with
                 2 mM Fura-2. Our results quantify Ca2+ signaling in
                 cardiomyocytes and suggest the existence of a Ca2+
                 microdomain which includes the DHP/ ryanodine receptors
                 complex, but excludes the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger. This
                 microdomain appears to be fairly inaccessible to high
                 concentrations of Ca2+ buffers.",

                 type-1 InsP(3) receptors of cerebellum is inhibited by
                 calmodulin [Patel, Morris, Adkins, O'Beirne and Taylor
                 (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94, 11627-11632].
                 Using cell types expressing predominantly type-1, -2 or
                 -3 InsP(3) receptors, we show that InsP(3)-evoked
                 Ca(2+) mobilization from each is similarly inhibited by
                 calmodulin. In SH-SY5Y cells, which express largely
                 type-1 receptors, calmodulin (IC(50) approximately 15
                 &mgr;M) inhibited InsP(3)-evoked Ca(2+) release only in
                 the presence of Ca(2+). The inhibition was unaffected
                 by calcineurin inhibitors. The effect of calmodulin did
                 not result from enhanced metabolism of InsP(3) because
                 calmodulin also decreased the sensitivity of the Ca(2+)
                 stores to adenophostin A, a non-metabolizable
                 InsP(3)-receptor agonist. Protein kinase A-catalysed
                 phosphorylation of type-1 InsP(3) receptors was
                 unaffected by Ca(2+)-calmodulin. Using a scintillation
                 proximity assay to measure (125)I-calmodulin binding to
                 glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins, we
                 identified two regions of the type-1 InsP(3) receptor
                 (cyt1, residues -6 to 159; and cyt11, residues
                 1499-1649) that bound (125)I-calmodulin. The
                 higher-affinity site (cyt11) was also photoaffinity
                 labelled with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate
                 (HSAB)-calmodulin. We speculate that Ca(2+)-independent
                 binding of calmodulin to a site within the first 159
                 residues of the type-1 InsP(3) receptor inhibits
                 InsP(3) binding and may thereby regulate the kinetics
                 of Ca(2+) release. Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of
                 Ca(2+) release by calmodulin is mediated by a different
                 site: it may reside on an accessory protein that
                 associates with all three receptor subtypes, or
                 Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding to a site lying between
                 residues 1499 and 1649 of the type-1 receptor may
                 inhibit Ca(2+) release from any tetrameric receptor
                 that includes a type-1 subunit.",

                 receptors - two related families of Ca(2+) channels
                 responsible for release of Ca(2+) from intracellular
                 stores [1] - are biphasically regulated by cytosolic
                 Ca(2+) [2] [3] [4]. It is thought that the resulting
                 positive feedback allows localised Ca(2+)-release
                 events to propagate regeneratively, and that the
                 negative feedback limits the amplitude of individual
                 events [5] [6]. Stimulation of IP(3) receptors by
                 Ca(2+) occurs through a Ca(2+)-binding site that
                 becomes exposed only after IP(3) has bound to its
                 receptor [7] [8]. Here, we report that rapid inhibition
                 of IP(3) receptors by Ca(2+) occurs only if the
                 receptor has not bound IP(3). The IP(3) therefore
                 switches its receptor from a state in which only an
                 inhibitory Ca(2+)-binding site is accessible to one in
                 which only a stimulatory site is available. This
                 regulation ensures that Ca(2+) released by an active
                 IP(3) receptor may rapidly inhibit its unliganded
                 neighbours, but it cannot terminate the activity of a
                 receptor with IP(3) bound. Such lateral inhibition,
                 which is a universal feature of sensory systems where
                 it improves contrast and dynamic range, may fulfil
                 similar roles in intracellular Ca(2+) signalling by

                 analyzed the possible involvement of
                 polyphosphoinositides in the metabolic regulation of
                 NHE1, the ubiquitous isoform of the Na(+)/H(+)
                 exchanger. Depletion of ATP was accompanied by a marked
                 reduction of plasmalemmal phosphatidylinositol
                 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) content. Moreover,
                 sequestration or hydrolysis of plasmalemmal PIP(2), in
                 the absence of ATP depletion, was associated with
                 profound inhibition of NHE1 activity. Examination of
                 the primary structure of the COOH-terminal domain of
                 NHE1 revealed two potential PIP(2)-binding motifs.
                 Fusion proteins encoding these motifs bound PIP(2) in
                 vitro. When transfected into antiport-deficient cells,
                 mutant forms of NHE1 lacking the putative
                 PIP(2)-binding domains had greatly reduced transport
                 capability, implying that association with PIP(2) is
                 required for optimal activity. These findings suggest
                 that NHE1 activity is modulated by phosphoinositides
                 and that the inhibitory effect of ATP depletion may be
                 attributable, at least in part, to the accompanying net

                 elevations in cytoplasmic Ca(2)+ concentration
                 ([Ca(2)+](i)) through a process of Ca(2)+-induced
                 Ca(2)+ release (CICR). In neurons, it is usually
                 assumed that CICR triggers net Ca(2)+ release from an
                 ER Ca(2)+ store. However, since net ER Ca(2)+ transport
                 depends on the relative rates of Ca(2)+ uptake and
                 release via distinct pathways, weak activation of a
                 CICR pathway during periods of ER Ca accumulation would
                 have a totally different effect: attenuation of Ca(2)+
                 accumulation. Stronger CICR activation at higher
                 [Ca(2)+](i) could further attenuate Ca(2)+ accumulation
                 or trigger net Ca(2)+ release, depending on the
                 quantitative properties of the underlying Ca(2)+

                 118:101-112) investigate which of these CICR modes
                 operate during depolarization-induced Ca(2)+ entry in
                 sympathetic neurons. The present study focuses on small
                 [Ca(2)+](i) elevations (less than approximately 350 nM)
                 evoked by weak depolarization. The following two
                 approaches were used: (1) Ca(2)+ fluxes were estimated
                 from simultaneous measurements of [Ca(2)+](i) and I(Ca)
                 in fura-2-loaded cells (perforated patch conditions),
                 and (2) total ER Ca concentrations ([Ca](ER)) were
                 measured using X-ray microanalysis. Flux analysis
                 revealed triggered net Ca(2)+ release during
                 depolarization in the presence but not the absence of
                 caffeine, and [Ca(2)+](i) responses were accelerated by
                 SERCA inhibitors, implicating ER Ca(2)+ accumulation,
                 which was confirmed by direct [Ca](ER) measurements.
                 Ryanodine abolished caffeine-induced CICR and enhanced
                 depolarization-induced ER Ca(2)+ accumulation,
                 indicating that activation of the CICR pathway normally
                 attenuates ER Ca(2)+ accumulation, which is a novel
                 mechanism for accelerating evoked [Ca(2)+](i)
                 responses. Theory shows how such a low gain mode of
                 CICR can operate during weak stimulation and switch to
                 net Ca(2)+ release at high [Ca(2)+](i), a transition
                 demonstrated in the companion study. These results
                 emphasize the importance of the relative rates of
                 Ca(2)+ uptake and release in defining ER contributions
                 to depolarization-induced Ca(2)+ signals.",

                 the synaptic signals in neuronal processes of
                 individual cells are complex and difficult to
                 understand in the absence of detailed, spatially
                 resolved measurements. Multi-site optical recording
                 with voltage-sensitive dyes from individual neurons in
                 situ was used to provide these kinds of measurements.
                 We analysed in detail the pattern of initiation and
                 propagation of spikes evoked synaptically in an
                 identified snail (Helix aspersa) neuron in situ. Two
                 main spike trigger zones were identified. The trigger
                 zones were activated selectively by different sets of
                 synaptic inputs which also produced different spike
                 propagation patterns. Synaptically evoked action
                 potentials did not always invade all parts of the

                 regularly blocked at particular locations on neuronal
                 processes. The propagating spikes in some axonal
                 branches consistently reversed direction at certain
                 branch points, a phenomenon known as reflection. These

                 to understanding how the brain works. A technique that
                 would allow recording of temporal and spatial dynamics
                 of electrical activity in neuronal processes with
                 adequate resolution would facilitate further research.
                 Here, we report on the application of optical recording
                 of membrane potential transients at many sites on
                 neuronal processes of vertebrate neurons in brain
                 slices using intracellular voltage-sensitive dyes. We
                 obtained evidence that 1) loading the neurons with
                 voltage-sensitive dye using patch electrodes is
                 possible without contamination of the extracellular
                 environment; 2) brain slices do not show any
                 autofluorescence at the excitation/emission wavelengths
                 used; 3) pharmacological effects of the dye were
                 completely reversible; 4) the level of photodynamic
                 damage already allows meaningful measurements and could
                 be reduced further; 5) the sensitivity of the dye was
                 comparable to that reported for invertebrate neurons;
                 6) the dye spread approximately 500 micron into distal
                 processes within 2 h incubation period. This distance
                 should increase with longer incubation; 7) the
                 optically recorded action potential signals from
                 basolateral dendrites (that are difficult or impossible
                 to approach by patch electrodes) and apical dendrites
                 show that both direct soma stimulation and synaptic
                 stimulation triggered action potentials that originated
                 near the soma. The spikes backpropagated into both
                 basolateral dendrites and apical processes; the
                 propagation was somewhat faster in the apical
                 dendrites.",

                 logic gates, sequential computers (universal Turing
                 machines), and parallel computers by means of the
                 kinetics of chemical reaction mechanisms. In the
                 present article we develop this subject further by
                 first investigating the computational properties of
                 several enzymatic (single and multiple) reaction
                 mechanisms: we show their steady states are analogous
                 to either Boolean or fuzzy logic gates. Nearly perfect
                 digital function is obtained only in the regime in
                 which the enzymes are saturated with their substrates.
                 With these enzymatic gates, we construct combinational
                 chemical networks that execute a given truth-table. The
                 dynamic range of a network's output is strongly
                 affected by input/output matching conditions among the
                 internal gate elements. We find a simple mechanism,
                 similar to the interconversion of fructose-6-phosphate
                 between its two bisphosphate forms
                 (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and
                 fructose-2,6-bisphosphate), that functions analogously
                 to an AND gate. When the simple model is supplanted
                 with one in which the enzyme rate laws are derived from
                 experimental data, the steady state of the mechanism
                 functions as an asymmetric fuzzy aggregation operator
                 with properties akin to a fuzzy AND gate. The
                 qualitative behavior of the mechanism does not change
                 when situated within a large model of
                 glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and the TCA cycle. The
                 mechanism, in this case, switches the pathway's mode
                 from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis in response to
                 chemical signals of low blood glucose (cAMP) and

                 thapsigargin, respectively, indicating that substantial
                 ER refilling occur during agonist stimulation. A larger
                 ER depletion was observed when mitochondrial Ca(2+)
                 uptake was prevented by oligomycin and rotenone or when
                 Ca(2+) efflux from mitochondria was blocked by CGP
                 37157, indicating that some of the Ca(2+) taken up by
                 mitochondria is re-used for ER refilling. Accordingly,
                 ER regions close to mitochondria released less Ca(2+)
                 than ER regions lacking mitochondria. The ER
                 heterogeneity was abolished by thapsigargin,
                 oligomycin/rotenone, or CGP 37157, indicating that
                 mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake locally modulate ER
                 refilling. These observations indicate that some
                 mitochondria are very close to the sites of Ca(2+)
                 release and recycle a substantial portion of the
                 captured Ca(2+) back to vicinal ER domains. The
                 distance between the two organelles thus determines
                 both the amplitude of mitochondrial Ca(2+) signals and
                 the filling state of neighboring ER regions.",

                 technique during electrically induced contractions in
                 the rabbit rectococcygeus smooth muscle at 22 degreesC.
                 The muscles were electrically activated to give short,
                 reproducible contractions. Intracellular [Ca2+]
                 increased during activation; the increase in [Ca2+]
                 preceded force development by approximately 2 s. After
                 cessation of stimulation Ca2+ fell, preceding the fall
                 in force by approximately 4 s. The fluorescence
                 properties of fura-2 were determined with time-resolved
                 spectroscopy using synchrotron light at the MAX-storage
                 ring, Lund, Sweden. The fluorescence decay of free
                 fura-2 was best described by two exponential decays
                 (time constants approximately 0.5 and 1.5 ns) at low
                 Ca2+ (pCa 9). At high Ca2+ (pCa 4.5), fluorescence
                 decay became slower and could be fitted by one
                 exponential decay (1.9 ns). Time-resolved anisotropy of
                 free fura-2 was characteristic of free rotational
                 motion (correlation time 0.3 ns). Motion of fura-2
                 could be markedly inhibited by high concentrations of
                 creatine kinase. Time-resolved spectroscopy
                 measurements of muscle fibers loaded with fura-2 showed
                 that the fluorescence lifetime of the probe was longer,
                 suggesting an influence of the chemical environment.
                 Anisotropy measurements revealed, however, that the
                 probe was mobile in the cells. The Ca2+-dependence of
                 contraction and relaxation was studied using a
                 photolabile calcium chelator, diazo-2, which could be
                 loaded into the muscle cells in a similar manner as
                 fura-2. Photolysis of diazo-2 leads to an increase in
                 its Ca2+-affinity and a fall in free Ca2+. When muscles
                 that had been loaded with diazo-2 were illuminated with
                 UV light flashes during the rising phase of
                 contraction, the rate of contraction became slower,
                 suggesting a close relation between intracellular Ca2+
                 and the cross-bridge interaction. In contrast,
                 photolysis during relaxation did not influence the rate
                 of force decay, suggesting that relaxation of these
                 contractions is not determined by the rate of Ca2+
                 removal or due to an increased Ca2+ sensitivity, but
                 instead is limited by other processes such as
                 deactivation by dephosphorylation or detachment of
                 tension-bearing cross-bridges, possibly regulated by
                 thin filament systems.",

                 with Caco-2 cells and phospholipid membranes reveals
                 that the compound interacts with the lipidic bilayer of
                 model membranes with a simple hyperbolic binding
                 profile but with Caco-2 cells in a cooperative way
                 involving membrane receptors. Additional studies
                 indicated that colchicine acts as a competitor ligand
                 to saquinavir and suggests, in agreement with other
                 reports, that the identity of the saquinavir receptor
                 could be P-glycoprotein or the multiple drug
                 resistance-associated protein. The modification of the
                 magnitude of the membrane dipole potential using
                 compounds such as cholesterol, phloretin, and
                 6-ketocholestanol influences the binding capacity of
                 saquinavir. Furthermore, removal of cholesterol from
                 the cell membrane using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin
                 significantly decreases the binding capacity of
                 saquinavir. Because removal of cholesterol from the
                 cell membrane has been reported to disrupt membrane
                 domains known as rafts, our observations imply that the
                 membrane dipole potential plays an important role as a
                 modulator of molecule-membrane interactions in these
                 membrane structures. Such a role is suggested to
                 contribute to the altered behavior of receptor-mediated

                 distinguish experimentally between the contributions of
                 messenger-induced Ca2+ release and CICR. We have
                 directly tested the CICR sensitivity of different
                 regions of intact pancreatic acinar cells using local
                 uncaging of caged Ca2+. In the apical region, local
                 uncaging of Ca2+ was able to trigger a CICR wave, which
                 propagated toward the base. CICR could not be triggered
                 in the basal region, despite the known presence of
                 ryanodine receptors. The triggering of CICR from the
                 apical region was inhibited by a pharmacological block
                 of ryanodine or inositol trisphosphate receptors,
                 indicating that global signals require coordinated Ca2+
                 release. Subthreshold agonist stimulation increased the
                 probability of triggering CICR by apical uncaging, and
                 uncaging-induced CICR could activate long-lasting Ca2+
                 oscillations. However, with subthreshold stimulation,
                 CICR could still not be initiated in the basal region.
                 CICR is the major process responsible for global Ca2+
                 transients, and intracellular variations in sensitivity

                 potential changes into changes in fluorescence
                 intensity. We have named this construct SPARC (sodium
                 channel protein-based activity reporting construct).
                 Green fluorescent protein was inserted into an
                 intracellular loop of a reversibly nonconducting form
                 of the rat &mgr;I skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium
                 channel. Rapid changes of the membrane potential
                 modulate the fluorescence of the inserted green
                 fluorescent protein. This change in fluorescence can
                 faithfully report depolarizing pulses as short as 2 ms.
                 The fluorescence signal does not inactivate during
                 extended depolarizations. Several features of the
                 probe's response properties indicate that it likely
                 reports gating charge movement of a single domain of
                 rat &mgr;I skeletal muscle. This probe provides a new
                 approach for studying rapid channel movements and may

                 now show that DsRed has a much higher extinction
                 coefficient and quantum yield than previously reported,
                 plus excellent resistance to pH extremes and
                 photobleaching. In addition, its 583-nm emission
                 maximum can be further shifted to 602 nm by mutation of
                 Lys-83 to Met. However, DsRed has major drawbacks, such
                 as strong oligomerization and slow maturation.
                 Analytical ultracentrifugation proves DsRed to be an
                 obligate tetramer in vitro, and fluorescence resonance
                 energy transfer measurements and yeast two-hybrid
                 assays verify oligomerization in live cells. Also,
                 DsRed takes days to ripen fully from green to red in
                 vitro or in vivo, and mutations such as Lys-83 to Arg
                 prevent the color change. Many potential cell
                 biological applications of DsRed will require
                 suppression of the tetramerization and acceleration of
                 the maturation.",

                 5-(5,7-dimethyl BODIPY)-1-pentanoic acid (C5-DMB-) in
                 large unilamellar lipid vesicles comprised of
                 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC). The
                 assay is based on the concentration-dependent changes
                 in fluorescence intensity that occur when donor
                 vesicles containing a C5-DMB-lipid are mixed with
                 nonfluorescent acceptor vesicles. A kinetic model was
                 developed to describe the time-dependent changes in
                 concentration of a lipid undergoing both spontaneous
                 transfer between unilamellar vesicles and transbilayer

                 with remarkable importance in regulating various cell
                 functions. They are synthesized from
                 phosphatidylinositol by sequential phosphorylations on
                 the several hydroxyls of the inositol ring to create
                 polyphosphoinositides that function either as docking
                 sites to promote formation of molecular signaling
                 complexes, or serve as precursors for soluble inositol
                 polyphosphates that act as diffusible intracellular
                 messengers. Phosphoinositides are involved in the
                 control of many processes, including membrane traffic,
                 endo- and exocytosis, mitogenesis and apoptosis.
                 Pharmacological tools have helped to clarify many
                 details of phosphoinositide metabolism and have
                 unveiled the roles of these lipids in the control of
                 specific signaling pathways. However, because of their
                 pleiotropic functions it has been questionable whether
                 pharmacological manipulation of inositide formation and
                 metabolism can be of therapeutic value. This review
                 briefly summarizes the means by which inositide
                 functions have been pharmacologically manipulated, and

                 for many important cellular processes, including
                 cell-cycle regulation and signal transduction. Here we
                 address the issue of the sensitivity of the networks to

                 demonstrated within a quantitative model which
                 explains, in a unified way, many aspects of chemotaxis,
                 including proper responses to chemical gradients. The
                 adaptation property is a consequence of the network's

                 reticulum-targeted, low Ca2+ affinity aequorin
                 reconstituted with coelenterazine n. Aequorin
                 consumption was much slower at 22 degrees C, and this
                 allowed performing a much longer study of the dynamics
                 of [Ca2+]er. The steady-state [Ca2+]er (500-600 microM)
                 was not modified by the temperature, although both the
                 rates of pumping and leak were decreased at 22 degrees
                 C. The behavior of both [Ca2+]er and cytoplasmic [Ca2+]
                 ([Ca2+]c) after the addition of increasing
                 concentrations of agonists and/or Ca2+-ATPase
                 inhibitors, or following incubation in Ca2+-free medium
                 were compared. We show that agonists induce a fast but
                 relatively small decrease in [Ca2+]er, which is enough
                 to produce a sharp increase in [Ca2+]c. Termination of
                 Ca2+ release is controlled by feedback inhibition of
                 the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors by [Ca2+]c,
                 a mechanism that appears to be designed to release the
                 minimum amount of Ca2+ necessary to produced the
                 required [Ca2+]c signal. We also show that Ca2+ release
                 is inhibited progressively when [Ca2+]er decreases
                 below a threshold of about 150 microM, even in the
                 absence of Ca2+ pumping or -Ca2+-c increase. This
                 effect is consistent with a regulation of the inositol

                 transition in the UV/visible/near-IR spectra of these
                 compounds is assigned to a metal-to-acceptor
                 transition, while the higher energy transition is
                 attributed to a transition to the acceptor-based LUMO
                 from the delocalized HOMO-3 orbital. The variations in
                 oscillator strength can be rationalized by considering
                 the low-energy transition as borrowing intensity from
                 the high-energy transition. Stark spectroscopy confirms
                 that large dipole moment changes are associated with
                 both transitions, as expected from our assignment.
                 These dipole moment changes indicate that, according to
                 the perturbation theory-derived expression for the
                 first hyperpolarizability, ‡, both transitions

                 blood-tissue exchange is only poorly represented by a
                 model consisting of sets of independent parallel
                 capillary-tissue units. We constructed a more realistic
                 multicapillary network model conforming statistically
                 to morphometric data. Flows through the tortuous paths
                 in the network were calculated based on constant
                 resistance per unit length throughout the network and
                 the resulting advective intracapillary velocity field
                 was used as a framework for describing the
                 extravascular diffusion of a substance for which there
                 is no barrier or permeability limitation. Simulated
                 impulse responses from the system, analogous to tracer
                 water outflow dilution curves, showed flow-limited
                 behavior over a range of flows from about 2 to 5 ml
                 min(-1) g(-1), as is observed for water in the heart in
                 vivo. The present model serves as a reference standard
                 against which to evaluate computationally simpler, less
                 physically realistic models. The simulated outflow
                 curves from the network model, like experimental water
                 curves, were matched to outflow curves from the
                 commonly used axially distributed models only by
                 setting the capillary wall permeability-surface area
                 (PS) to a value so artifactually low that it is
                 incompatible with the experimental observations that
                 transport is flow limited. However, simple axially
                 distributed models with appropriately high PSs will fit
                 water outflow dilution curves if axial diffusion
                 coefficients are set at high enough values to account
                 for enhanced dispersion due to the complex geometry of
                 the capillary network. Without incorporating this
                 enhanced dispersion, when applied to experimental
                 curves over a range of flows, the simpler models give a
                 false inference that there is recruitment of capillary
                 surface area with increasing flow. Thus distributed
                 models must account for diffusional as well as
                 permeation processes to provide physiologically
                 appropriate parameter estimates.",

                 cavity for which paraxial wave theory may be applied
                 successfully and where losses, aperturing, and
                 aberrations can be ignored. The resonator need not be
                 planar ( so that image rotation may occur), the optical
                 elements may be astigmatic and the optic axis
                 incompletely defined (such as when dispersive prisms

                 paraxial (pencillike) modes is provided, including the

                 that go beyond ATP supply. A recent advance has been
                 the discovery that mitochondria contain and release
                 proteins that are involved in the apoptotic cascade,
                 like cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor. The
                 involvement of mitochondria in cell death, and its
                 being cause or consequence, remain issues that are
                 extremely complex to address in situ. The response of
                 mitochondria may critically depend on the type of
                 stimulus, on its intensity, and on the specific
                 mitochondrial function that has been primarily
                 perturbed. On the other hand, the outcome also depends
                 on the integration of mitochondrial responses that
                 cannot be dissected easily. Here, we try to identify
                 the mechanistic aspects of mitochondrial involvement in
                 cell death as can be derived from our current
                 understanding of mitochondrial physiology, with special

                 consequences (like onset of swelling, cytochrome c

                 and are largely responsible for releasing Ca which

                 cells, mitochondria respond dynamically to
                 physiological changes in cytosolic Ca(2+)
                 concentrations ([Ca(2+)](c)). Mitochondrial Ca(2+)
                 uptake occurs via a ruthenium red-sensitive calcium
                 uniporter and a rapid mode of Ca(2+) uptake.
                 Surprisingly, the molecular identity of these Ca(2+)
                 transport proteins is still unknown. Using electron
                 microscopy and Western blotting, we identified a
                 ryanodine receptor in the inner mitochondrial membrane
                 with a molecular mass of approximately 600 kDa in
                 mitochondria isolated from the rat heart.
                 [(3)H]Ryanodine binds to this mitochondrial ryanodine
                 receptor with high affinity. This binding is modulated
                 by Ca(2+) but not caffeine and is inhibited by Mg(2+)
                 and ruthenium red in the assay medium. In the presence
                 of ryanodine, Ca(2+) uptake into isolated heart
                 mitochondria is suppressed. In addition, ryanodine
                 inhibited mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca(2+)
                 overload. This swelling effect was not observed when
                 Ca(2+) was applied to the cytosolic fraction containing
                 sarcoplasmic reticulum. These results are the first to
                 identify a mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport protein that
                 has characteristics similar to the ryanodine receptor.
                 This mitochondrial ryanodine receptor is likely to play
                 an essential role in the dynamic uptake of Ca(2+) into
                 mitochondria during Ca(2+) oscillations.",

                 with macroscopic data and gating current noise
                 analysis, in relation to the operation of the voltage
                 sensor and the opening of the channel. Structural
                 details of the voltage sensor operation were resolved
                 initially by locating the residues that make up the
                 voltage sensor using mutagenesis experiments and
                 determining the number of charges per channel. The
                 changes in conformation are then analyzed based on the
                 differential exposure of cysteine or
                 histidine-substituted residues. Site-directed
                 fluorescence labeling is then analyzed as another
                 powerful indicator of conformational changes that
                 allows time and voltage correlation of local changes
                 seen by the fluorophores with the global change seen by
                 the electrophysiology of gating currents and ionic
                 currents. Finally, we describe the novel results on
                 lanthanide-based resonance energy transfer that show
                 small distance changes between residues in the channel
                 molecule. All of the electrophysiological and the
                 structural information are finally summarized in a
                 physical model of a voltage-dependent channel in which
                 a change in membrane potential causes rotation of the
                 S4 segment that changes the exposure of the basic
                 residues from an internally connected aqueous crevice
                 at hyperpolarized potentials to an externally connected
                 aqueous crevice at depolarized potentials.",

                 including few attempts in neural cells. Basically, in
                 this system the plasmid DNA of interest is coated onto
                 small particles, that are accelerated by a particular
                 driving force. The combination of several so-called
                 'ballistic' parameters and tissue parameters determine
                 the transfection efficiency. The main advantage of the
                 system is that it is, unlike other available
                 transfection methods, a mechanical way to cross the
                 plasma membrane and therefore less dependent on target
                 cell characteristics. In terms of transfection

                 calcium ([Ca2+]i), which took the form of sinusoidal
                 oscillations. These oscillations were relatively
                 constant (approximately 4-5/min) regardless of the

                 metabolically stable analog of inositol
                 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate
                 ((2,4,5)IP3), stimulated both intracellular Ca2+
                 mobilization and Ca2+ entry. Microinjection of inositol
                 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate ((1,3,4,5)IP4), the inositol
                 1,4,5-trisphosphate-3-kinase product, was ineffective
                 at mobilizing intracellular Ca2+ or activating Ca2+
                 entry. In lacrimal cells previously microinjected with
                 submaximal levels of (2,4,5)IP3, the subsequent
                 microinjection of low to moderate concentrations of
                 (1,3,4,5)IP4 did not result in additional release of
                 intracellular Ca2+, nor did it potentiate the Ca2+
                 entry phase attributable to (2,4,5)IP3. However, as
                 previously demonstrated (Bird, G. S. J., Rossier, M.
                 F., Hughes, A. R., Shears, S. B., Armstrong, D. L., and
                 Putney, J. W., Jr. (1991) Nature 352, 162-165),
                 additional injections of (2,4,5)IP3 induced further
                 mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and increased the
                 elevated and sustained Ca2+ entry phase. Introduction
                 of high concentrations of (1,3,4,5)IP4 appeared to
                 inhibit or block the (2,4,5)IP3-induced Ca2+ entry
                 phase. These results were consistent with the observed
                 effect of (1,3,4,5)IP4 in permeabilized lacrimal cells,
                 where (1,3,4,5)IP4 did not release cellular 45Ca2+ but
                 at high concentrations inhibited the ability of
                 submaximal concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3 to release
                 45Ca2+. Likewise, injection of a high concentration of
                 (1,3,4,5)IP4 prior to injection of (2,4,5)IP3 blocked
                 both release and influx of Ca2+. The inhibitory action
                 of (1,3,4,5)IP4 on Ca2+ signaling observed in intact
                 cells occurred at concentrations that might be obtained
                 in agonist-stimulated cells. However, in permeabilized
                 cells, (1,3,4,5)IP4 inhibited Ca2+ mobilization at
                 concentrations exceeding those likely to occur in
                 agonist-stimulated cells. These results suggest that
                 physiologically relevant levels of (1,3,4,5)IP4 in the
                 cell cytoplasm do not release Ca2+, nor do they
                 potentiate inositol trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ entry
                 across the plasma membrane. Rather, the possibility is
                 raised that (1,3,4,5)IP4 or one of its metabolites
                 could function as a negative feedback on Ca2+
                 mobilization by inhibiting inositol
                 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release.",

                 release events originate at individual channels. In
                 cardiac muscle, however, it remains a question of
                 debate whether localized Ca2+ release transients,

                 cell-averaged Ca2+ release, we derived, as a function
                 of space and time, the flux of Ca2+ release that
                 underlies Ca2+ sparks. Using the method to analyze
                 spontaneous sparks recorded with confocal microscopy in

                 single sparks of Ca2+ release that appear to originate

                 cases, doublets, triplets, and greater groups of
                 release sparks were observed. This multiplicity, the

                 to explore the interplay between mitochondrial Ca2+
                 uptake and physiological Ca2+ signaling in rat cortical
                 astrocytes. A rise in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt),
                 resulting from mobilization of ER Ca2+ stores was
                 followed by a rise in mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m,
                 monitored using rhod-2). Whereas [Ca2+]cyt recovered
                 within approximately 1 min, the time to recovery for
                 [Ca2+]m was approximately 30 min. Dissipating the
                 mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim, using the
                 mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide
                 p-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl-hydrazone [FCCP] with
                 oligomycin) prevented mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and
                 slowed the rate of decay of [Ca2+]cyt transients,
                 suggesting that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays a
                 significant role in the clearance of physiological
                 [Ca2+]cyt loads in astrocytes. Ca2+ signals in these
                 cells initiated either by receptor-mediated ER Ca2+
                 release or mechanical stimulation often consisted of
                 propagating waves (measured using fluo-3). In response
                 to either stimulus, the wave traveled at a mean speed
                 of 22.9 +/-11.2 micrometer/s (n = 262). This was
                 followed by a wave of mitochondrial depolarization
                 (measured using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester
                 [TMRE]), consistent with Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria
                 as the Ca2+ wave traveled across the cell. Collapse of
                 Deltapsim to prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake
                 significantly increased the rate of propagation of the
                 Ca2+ waves by 50\%. Taken together, these data suggest
                 that cytosolic Ca2+ buffering by mitochondria provides
                 a potent mechanism to regulate the localized spread of
                 astrocytic Ca2+ signals.",

                 messenger, controlling a diverse range of cellular
                 processes, such as gene transcription, muscle
                 contraction and cell proliferation. The ability of a
                 simple ion such as Ca(2+) to play a pivotal role in
                 cell biology results from the facility that cells have
                 to shape Ca(2+) signals in space, time and amplitude.
                 To generate and interpret the variety of observed
                 Ca(2+) signals, different cell types employ components
                 selected from a Ca(2+) signalling 'toolkit', which
                 comprises an array of homeostatic and sensory
                 mechanisms. By mixing and matching components from the
                 toolkit, cells can obtain Ca(2+) signals that suit
                 their physiology. Recent studies have demonstrated the
                 importance of local Ca(2+) signals in defining the
                 specificity of the interaction of Ca(2+) with its
                 targets. Furthermore, local Ca(2+) signals are the
                 triggers and building blocks for larger global signals
                 that propagate throughout cells.",

                 the tissue with an extracellular voltage-sensitive dye
                 (Di-4-ANEPPS) and impaling a single neuron with a

                 potential is shifted by a periodic current injection

                 cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cardiac
                 myocytes has been largely discounted by many authors.
                 However, recent evidence, including the results of this
                 study, has forced a reappraisal of this role. [Ca2+]i
                 and Ca2+ in the mitochondria ([Ca2+]m) were measured in
                 this study with specific fluorescent probes, fluo-3 and
                 di-hydro-rhod-2, respectively; mitochondrial membrane
                 potential (DeltaPsim) was monitored with JC-1. Addition
                 of uncouplers or inhibitors of the mitochondrial
                 respiratory chain was found to cause a twofold decrease
                 in the rate of removal of Ca2+ from the cytosol after a
                 spontaneously generated Ca2+ wave. These agents also
                 caused a progressive elevation of [Ca2+]i, an increase
                 in the number of hotspots of Ca2+ release (Ca2+
                 sparks), and depression of mitochondrial potential. The
                 Ca2+-indicative fluorophore dihydro-rhod-2 has a net
                 positive charge that contributes to selective
                 accumulation by mitochondria, as supported by its
                 co-localization with other mitochondrial-specific
                 probes (MitoTracker Green). Treatment of
                 dihydro-rhod-2-loaded cells with NaCN resulted in rapid
                 formation of black holes in the otherwise uniformly
                 banded pattern. These are likely to represent
                 individual or small groups of mitochondria that have
                 depressed mitochondrial potential, or have lost
                 accumulated rhod-2 and/or Ca2+; all of these
                 eventualities are possible upon onset of the
                 mitochondrial permeability transition. Release of Ca2+
                 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the resultant
                 spontaneous contractility of cardiac muscle are
                 proposed to be triggered by the induction of the
                 mitochondrial permeability transition and the
                 subsequent loss of [Ca2+]m.",

  abstract =     "The rate of aerobic Ca2+ transport is limited by the
                 rate of the H+ pump rather than by the Ca2+ carrier.
                 The kinetics of the Ca2+ carrier has therefore been
                 studied by using the K+ diffusion potential as the
                 driving force. The apparent Vmax of the Ca2+ carrier
                 is, at 20 degrees C, about 900 nmol (mg of protein)-1
                 min-1, more than twice the rate of the H+ pump. The
                 apparent Vmax is depressed by Mg2+ and Li+. This
                 supports the view that the electrolytes act as
                 noncompetitive inhibitors of the Ca2+ carrier. The
                 degree of sigmoidicity of the kinetics of Ca2+
                 transport increases with the lowering of the
                 temperature and proportionally with the concentration
                 of impermeant electrolytes such as Mg2+ and Li+ but not
                 choline. The effects of temperature and of electrolyte
                 do not support the view that the sigmoidicity is due to
                 modifications of the surface potential. Rather, they
                 suggest that Ca2+ transport occurs through a
                 multisubunit carrier, where cooperative phenomena are
                 the result of ligand-induced conformational changes due
                 to the interaction of several allosteric effectors with
                 the carrier subunits. In contrast with La3+ which acts
                 as a competitive inhibitor, Ruthenium Red affects the
                 kinetics by inducing phenomena both of positive and of
                 negative cooperativity. The Ruthenium Red induced
                 kinetics has been reproduced through curve-fitting
                 procedures by applying the Koshland sequential
                 interaction hypothesis to a four-subunit Ca2+ carrier

                 of the pulse width at the focal point of a high-NA
                 lens, based on two-photon absorption interferometric
                 autocorrelation, is presented. The technique is applied
                 to measuring the pulse broadening induced on a pulse
                 propagating through a high-NA lens system for several
                 objectives. It is known that the pulse width may
                 increase by up to approximately=50\% of its original
                 value by propagation through an objective which has
                 wide field compensation for spherical and chromatic
                 aberrations. The two-photon absorption autocorrelation
                 technique allows adjustment of the actual pulse width
                 in the focus of a high-NA lens through pre-chirp
                 compensation. The pulse width is shown to be almost
                 independent of penetration depth into the sample. While
                 the amplitude of the autocorrelation signal shows a
                 strong decrease with depth. The ability to both measure
                 and control the actual pulse width under strong
                 focusing conditions is of direct importance to, among
                 others, two-photon absorption imaging approaches.",

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: There is a pressing need for new sensors
                 that can detect a variety of analytes, ranging from
                 simple ions to complex compounds and even
                 microorganisms. The devices should offer sensitivity,
                 speed, reversibility and selectivity. Given these
                 criteria, protein pores, remodeled so that their
                 transmembrane conductances are modulated by the
                 association of specific analytes, are excellent
                 prospects as components of biosensors. RESULTS:
                 Structure-based design and a separation method that
                 employs targeted chemical modification have been used
                 to obtain a heteromeric form of the bacterial
                 pore-forming protein staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin, in
                 which one of the seven subunits contains a binding site
                 for a divalent metal ion, M(II), which serves as a
                 prototypic analyte. The single-channel current of the
                 heteromer in planar bilayers is modulated by nanomolar
                 Zn(II). Other M(II)s modulate the current and produce
                 characteristic signatures. In addition, heteromers
                 containing more than one mutant subunit exhibit
                 distinct responses to M(II)s Hence, a large collection
                 of responsive pores can be generated through subunit
                 diversity and combinatorial assembly. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Engineered pores have several advantages as potential
                 sensor elements: sensitivity is in the nanomolar range;
                 analyte binding is rapid (diffusion limited in some
                 cases) and reversible; strictly selective binding is
                 not required because single-channel recordings are rich
                 in information; and for a particular analyte, the
                 dissociation rate constant, the extent of channel block
                 and the voltage-dependence of these parameters are
                 distinguishing, while the frequency of partial channel
                 block reflects the analyte concentration. A single
                 sensor element might, therefore, be used to quantitate
                 more than one analyte at once. The approach described
                 here can be generalized for additional analytes.",

                 shown to reduce contractility but paradoxically to
                 increase O2 consumption rates at a given force. Because
                 O2 consumption rates are related to mitochondrial
                 [NADH] ([NADH]m), we tested the hypothesis that with
                 hypertrophy, control of [NADH]m may be altered. Left
                 ventricular trabeculae were isolated from banded and
                 control rat hearts, and fluorescence spectroscopy was
                 used to monitor [NADH]m and cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c).
                 The hearts from banded rats developed hypertrophy
                 (heart-to-body weight ratio increased from 4.1+/-0.1 to
                 4.9+/-0.1 mg/g) and hypertension (systolic arterial
                 pressure increased from 117+/-4 to 175+/-5 mm Hg).
                 Muscle workload was increased by stepwise increases in
                 pacing frequency (up to 2 Hz). After increased work,
                 [NADH]m fell and then slowly recovered toward control
                 levels. When work was decreased, [NADH]m overshot
                 control values and then slowly returned. The
                 Ca2+-independent initial fall was larger for trabeculae
                 from rats with hypertrophied hearts than from control
                 rats (eg, 17+/-2\% versus 11+/-1\% when work was
                 increased by increasing the frequency from 0.25 to 1
                 Hz). At 1 Hz, average [Ca2+]c was approximately 280
                 nmol/L, and the Ca2+-dependent [NADH]m recovery was
                 larger for trabeculae from rats with hypertrophied
                 hearts (17+/-4\% versus 10+/-2\%) despite similar
                 average [Ca2+]c. At steady state after Ca2+-dependent
                 recovery, there was no difference in [NADH]m (fall of
                 1+/-2\% versus 1+/-1\%). Furthermore, the
                 Ca2+-dependent overshoot was larger for trabeculae from
                 hypertrophied than from control hearts (increase of
                 14+/-2\% versus 9+/-2\% when frequency was decreased
                 from 1 to 0.25 Hz). We conclude that (1) there is
                 initially a larger imbalance in NADH production versus
                 consumption rate in hypertrophy (because NADH fell
                 more) and (2) the Ca2+-dependent recovery mechanism is
                 enhanced in hypertrophy (because NADH recovered and
                 overshot more), thus compensating for the larger
                 imbalance.",

                 attractants, concentrations of less than 5 nM in the
                 case of aspartate. They also sense gradients of
                 attractants extending over five orders of magnitude in
                 concentration (up to 1 mM aspartate). Here we consider
                 the possibility that this combination of sensitivity
                 and range of response depends on the clustering of
                 chemotactic receptors on the surface of the bacterium.
                 We examine what will happen if ligand binding changes
                 the activity of a receptor, propagating this change in
                 activity to neighbouring receptors in a cluster.
                 Calculations based on these assumptions show that
                 sensitivity to extracellular ligands increases with the
                 extent of spread of activity through an array of
                 receptors, but that the range of concentrations over
                 which the array works is severely diminished. However,
                 a combination of low threshold of response and wide
                 dynamic range can be attained if the cell has both
                 clusters and single receptors on its surface,
                 particularly if the extent of activity spread can adapt
                 to external conditions. A mechanism of this kind can
                 account quantitatively for the sensitivity and response

                 donor-acceptor stilbene compounds using the ZINDO
                 (sum-over-states) formalism. Because of the inherent
                 dipolar nature of thiazole, in which C2 is
                 electron-poor and C5 is electron-rich, the relative
                 orientation of the thiazole subunit in the dipolar
                 chromophore dramatically affects the nonlinear optical
                 properties. In the mismatched case, the dipole of the
                 thiazole ring opposes the molecular dipole created by
                 the donor-acceptor substituents, while in the matched
                 case, the dipole of the thiazole ring reinforces the
                 molecular dipale. The hyperpolarizability of the
                 mismatched monothiazole 2 (beta(mu) = 68 x 10(-30)
                 cm(5) esu(-1)) exceeds that of stilbene 1 (beta(mu) =
                 34 x 10(-30) cm(5) esu(-1)) but is smaller than that of
                 monothiophene 4 (beta(mu) = 90 x 10(-30) cm(5)
                 esu(-1)). By contrast, the hyperpolarizability of the

                 esu(-1)) exceeds not only that of the mismatched
                 monothiazole 2, but also that of monothiophene 4.
                 Substituting thiazole for both aryl rings of stilbene
                 produces very large hyperpolarizabilities in the

                 governing the delivery of therapeutic molecules in
                 tumors. Thus, simple histological staining of tumor
                 tissue biopsies for collagen could be used to assess
                 the accessibility of molecular therapeutics in tumors.
                 Here we show that it is possible to optically image
                 fibrillar collagen in tumors growing in mice using
                 second-harmonic generation (SHG). Using this
                 noninvasive technique, we estimated relative diffusive
                 hindrance, quantified the dynamics of collagen
                 modification after pharmacologic intervention and
                 provided mechanistic insight into improved diffusive
                 transport induced by the hormone relaxin. This
                 technology could offer basic scientists and clinicians
                 an enhanced ability to estimate the relative
                 penetrabilities of molecular therapeutics.",

  abstract =     "1. Membrane current responses to focal application of
                 bradykinin (BK) were recorded in voltage-clamped
                 NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells. 2. BK
                 produced sequential outward and inward currents at
                 clamp potentials between -60 and -30 mV, designated
                 IBK(out) and IBK(in), respectively. 3. The outward
                 current IBK(out) was accompanied by an increased
                 membrane conductance. Ramp current-voltage (I-V) curves
                 yielded a reversal potential (VBK) of -80 +/- 5.6 mV
                 (mean +/- S.D., n = 9) in 5.4 mM [K+]o. VBK showed a
                 positive shift on raising [K+]o, compatible with a
                 primary increase in K+ conductance. Subtracted I-V
                 curves indicated that the underlying conductance was
                 not strongly voltage dependent between -120 and -40 mV.
                 4. IBK(out) was inhibited by d-tubocurarine (dTC,
                 0.1-0.5 mM) but was insensitive to tetraethylammonium
                 (TEA) below 5 mM. 5. The inward current IBK(in) was
                 accompanied by a fall in membrane conductance. This was
                 associated with the inhibition of a time- and
                 voltage-dependent K+ current, IM. In consequence,
                 IBK(in) was strongly voltage dependent and dissipated,
                 usually without reversal, on hyperpolarizing the cell
                 beyond -70 mV in 5.4 mM [K+]o. Reversal to an outward
                 current negative to -40 mV could be obtained on raising
                 [K+]o to 54 mM. 5. Both IBK(in) and IBK(out) persisted
                 when ICa was blocked with Co2+ or Cd2+. IBK(out) slowly
                 diminished in Ca2+-free, Mg2+-substituted solution. 6.
                 The Ca2+ spike current ICa and the Ca2+-activated K+
                 current IAHP were inhibited during IBK(out) or after
                 Ca2+ injections. BK did not affect the
                 voltage-activated K+ current IK(V) recorded in Co2+
                 solution. 7. It is concluded that the dual response to
                 BK results from opposing effects on two different
                 species of K+ current. IBK(out) results from activation
                 of a Ca2+-dependent, voltage-insensitive K+
                 conductance, probably mediated by a transient rise in
                 intracellular Ca2+. It is suggested that the Ca2+ is
                 released from an intracellular store. IBK(in) results
                 primarily from inhibition of the Ca2+-independent,
                 voltage-gated K+ current, IM. This effect is not
                 replicated by a rise of intracellular Ca2+ and must
                 therefore be generated by another mechanism.",

                 glioma hybrid cells to bradykinin (BK, Brown &
                 Higashida, 1988b) has been tested using intracellular
                 ionophoresis of InsP3 and external application of
                 phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol
                 (OAG). 2. Intracellular ionophoresis of InsP3 into
                 cells clamped at -30 to -50 mV produced (i) a transient
                 outward current, (ii) a transient outward current
                 followed by an inward current, or (iii) an inward
                 current. All currents were accompanied by an increased
                 input conductance. 3. The transient outward current
                 reversed at between -80 and -90 mV. The reversal
                 potential was shifted to more positive potentials on
                 raising extracellular [K+], suggesting that it resulted
                 from an increased K+ conductance. 4. The outward
                 current was inhibited by apamin (0.4 microM) or
                 d-tubocurarine (0.2-0.5 mM); these drugs also inhibit
                 the outward current produced by BK or by intracellular
                 Ca2+ injections (Brown & Higashida, 1988 a, b). The
                 outward current was also slowly reduced in 0 mM [Ca2+]
                 or 0.5 mM [Cd2+] plus 2 mM [Co2+] solution. 5.
                 Ionophoretic injection of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate
                 and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, guanosine
                 trisphosphate or inorganic phosphate did not evoke an
                 outward current but produced only an inward current
                 with an increased conductance, reversing at between -10
                 and -20 mV. 6. Bath application of PDBu (10 nM-1
                 microM) or OAG (1-10 microM) produced an inward current
                 with a fall in input conductance. The inward current
                 was voltage dependent and was accompanied by an
                 inhibition of the time-dependent current relaxations
                 associated with activation or deactivation of the
                 voltage-dependent K+ current, IM. 7. PDBu did not
                 clearly reduce the Ca2+ current or the Ca2+-dependent
                 K+ current recorded in these cells. During superfusion
                 with PDBu, the outward current produced by
                 intracellular ionophoresis of InsP3 was greatly
                 enhanced. 8. The results support the view that the two
                 membrane current responses to BK might both result from
                 accelerated membrane phosphatidylinositide hydrolysis.
                 One product, InsP3, releases Ca2+ and activates an
                 apamin-curare-sensitive outward K+ current; this effect
                 is imitated by intracellular InsP3 ionophoresis. The
                 second product, DAG; activates protein kinase C to
                 inhibit the voltage-dependent K+ current IM and
                 generate an inward current; this effect is imitated by
                 external application of PDBu or OAG.",

                 (AAC) has been shown in a preliminary communication to
                 produce electrical capacitive currents on photolysis of
                 caged ATP or ADP with reconstituted AAC liposomes
                 attached to black lipid membranes [Brustovetsky, N.,
                 Becker, A., Klingenberg, M., and Bamberg, E. (1996)
                 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93, 664-668]. Here we
                 study the relation of the currents to ADP/ATP fluxes,
                 the interaction of caged ADP and ATP with AAC and other
                 basic facets of this method. Caged ADP and ATP are not
                 transported by the AAC, as shown in mitochondria. Flux
                 measurements with reconstituted AAC show that caged
                 nucleotides are competitive inhibitors (Ki = 5 microM
                 for caged ADP and 1 microM for caged ATP). Caged ATP
                 competes with photolyzed ATP as shown by the dependence
                 of the currents on the caged ATP concentration and on
                 the light intensity. A competition of added ADP with
                 caged ATP on the currents yields Ki = 50 microM for
                 ADP. We conclude that caged ADP and ATP bind tighter to
                 AAC than ADP or ATP, allowing immediate initiation of
                 translocation by in situ photolysis. The caged
                 compounds bind preferentially at the cytosolic side of
                 AAC. With a regenerative hexokinase + glucose system,
                 the currents are stabilized in repetitive flashes and
                 can be used for applying inhibitors etc. during a flash
                 series. The currents are completely inhibited by the
                 combined addition of the AAC inhibitors bongkrekate
                 (BKA) and carboxyatractylate (CAT). The partial
                 inhibition by CAT or BKA is dependent on the number of
                 flash cycles increasing from 60\% to 90\%, and by
                 replacing chloride with gluconate from only 30\% to
                 90\%. The current are increased by a K+ diffusion
                 potential (valinomycin + KCl) and decreased by the
                 permeant anion TPB-. The pH dependence of the currents
                 and of the parallel flux measurements indicates that
                 only the fully charged ATP4- and ADP3-are transported.
                 A strong temperature dependence of the currents with a
                 break at 15 degrees C (EA = 95 and 28 kJ) agrees with
                 former measurements of flux rates in mitochondria. In
                 conclusion, the capacitive currents faithfully reflect
                 AAC transport function and are a powerful tool for
                 investigating the charge transfer in transport.",

                 C (PLC), including those for Arg(8)-vasopressin (AVP)
                 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), caused a

                 examined in a stable variant of the A7r5 cell line in
                 which the usual ability of hormones to stimulate
                 non-capacitative Ca(2+) entry is not expresssed. In

                 [Ca(2+)](i), without affecting the response to maximal
                 or submaximal concentrations of AVP. Similar
                 experiments with PDGF were impracticable because
                 Ro31-8220, presumably by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase
                 activity of the PDGF receptor, abolished all responses
                 to PDGF. U73122 (10 microM), an inhibitor of PLC,
                 completely inhibited PDGF- or AVP-evoked Ca(2+)
                 mobilization, without preventing either stimulus from
                 causing a decrease in [Ca(2+)](i). We conclude that
                 receptors coupled to PLC, whether via G-proteins or
                 protein tyrosine kinase activity, also share an ability
                 to stimulate the plasma membrane Ca(2+) pump via a
                 mechanism that does not require PLC activity.",

                 two-photon uncaging action cross section (deltau) of
                 photolyzable calcium cages is described. This technique
                 is potentially applicable to other caged species that
                 can be chelated by a fluorescent indicator dye, as well
                 as caged fluorescent compounds. The two-photon action
                 cross sections of three calcium cages, DM-nitrophen,
                 NP-EGTA, and azid-1, are studied in the range of
                 excitation wavelengths between 700 and 800 nm. Azid-1
                 has a maximum deltau of approximately 1.4 GM at 700 nm,
                 DM-nitrophen has a maximum deltau of approximately
                 0.013 GM at 730 nm, and NP-EGTA has no measurable
                 uncaging yield. The equations necessary to predict the
                 amount of cage photolyzed and the temporal behavior of
                 the liberated calcium distribution under a variety of
                 conditions are derived. These equations predict that by
                 using 700-nm light from a Ti:sapphire laser focused
                 with a 1.3-NA objective, essentially all of the azid-1
                 within the two-photon focal volume would be photolyzed
                 with a 10-&mgr;s pulse train of approximately 7 mW
                 average power. The initially localized distributions of
                 free calcium will dissipate rapidly because of
                 diffusion of free calcium and uptake by buffers. In
                 buffer-free cytoplasm, the elevation of the calcium
                 concentration at the center of the focal volume is

                 responses to calcium challenges under varying
                 conditions. Mitochondrial membrane potential was
                 monitored by following the distribution of
                 tetraphenylphosphonium ions in the mitochondrial
                 suspension, mitochondrial swelling by observing
                 absorbance changes, calcium accumulation by an external
                 calcium electrode, and oxygen consumption with an
                 oxygen electrode. Both the extent and rate of
                 calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling and
                 depolarization varied greatly depending on the energy
                 source provided to the mitochondria. When energized
                 with succinate plus glutamate, after a calcium
                 challenge, CNS mitochondria depolarized transiently,
                 accumulated substantial calcium, and increased in
                 volume, characteristic of a mitochondrial permeability
                 transition. When energized with 3 mM succinate, CNS
                 mitochondria maintained a sustained calcium-induced
                 depolarization without appreciable swelling and were
                 slow to accumulate calcium. Maximal oxygen consumption
                 was also restricted under these conditions, preventing
                 the electron transport chain from compensating for this
                 increased proton permeability. In 3 mM succinate,
                 cyclosporin A and ADP plus oligomycin restored
                 potential and calcium uptake. This low conductance
                 permeability was not effected by bongkrekic acid or
                 carboxyatractylate, suggesting that the adenine
                 nucleotide translocator was not directly involved.
                 Fura-2FF measurements of [Ca(2+)](i) suggest that in
                 cultured hippocampal neurons glutamate-induced
                 increases reached tens of micromolar levels,
                 approaching those used with mitochondria. We propose
                 that in the restricted substrate environment, Ca(2+)
                 activated a low-conductance permeability pathway
                 responsible for the sustained mitochondrial

                 is excitotoxic, as demonstrated by a collapse of the

                 cell death. Glutamate-evoked Ca2+ deregulation is
                 exacerbated by the mitochondrial respiratory chain
                 inhibitor rotenone. Cells maintained by glycolytic ATP,
                 i.e., in the presence of the mitochondrial ATP synthase

                 disruption of mitochondrial ATP synthesis is not a

                 the combination of rotenone (or antimycin A) plus

                 maintaining a low bulk cytoplasmic free Ca2+
                 concentration determined by fura-2. It is concluded
                 that mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation is a necessary
                 intermediate in glutamate excitotoxicity, whereas the
                 decreased Ca2+ flux into cells with depolarized
                 mitochondria may reflect a feedback inhibition of the

                 simultaneous detection at two emission wavelengths. The

                 di-8-butyl-amino-naphthyl-ethylene-pyridinium-propyl-sulfonate
                 (di-8-ANEPPS). Optical measurements are made at two
                 emission wavelengths, using secondary dichroic
                 beamsplitting and dual photodetectors (<570 nm and >570

                 centrosome positioning requires a radial array of
                 cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs) that can exert pushing
                 or pulling forces involving MT dynamics and the

                 suggested that actomyosin can play a direct or indirect

                 mechanisms, we introduced an imbalance of forces acting

                 of MT assembly (nocodazole), and studied the resulting

                 centrosome at the cell center, and that other forces

                 optical field in conjunction with a gas target to
                 produce a highly-ionized plasma filament suitable for
                 recombination XUV lasers in both transient and
                 quasi-steady-state regimes. A distinction is made
                 between low Z ions which can be stripped to the desired
                 ionization state and higher Z ions which require
                 relativistic intensities to produce the desired
                 ionization. In the nonrelativistic case (Ei < 500 eV),
                 it is shown that electron thermal conduction is
                 extremely effective in cooling approx. 10 µm diameter
                 filaments imbedded in cold background plasma at
                 densities required for quasi-steady-state gain on 4-3
                 and 3-2 transitions. These filaments can be cooled to
                 the required temperatures with very little hydrodynamic
                 motion and with little sensitivity to the initial
                 temperature and typically reach small-signal gain much
                 in excess of that usually predicted in expansion cooled
                 systems. In the relativistic case, self-focusing of the
                 ionizing laser radiation may lead to very small
                 diameter, electron-cavitated filaments which will
                 undergo a space-charge-driven expansion (Coulomb
                 explosion) on the time scale of an ion plasma period,
                 resulting in the emission of extremely high currents of
                 moderate energy (E aprox. 1/8 Zmc^2) ions. We discuss
                 the implications of such filamentation for the scaling
                 of the present type of recombination laser to short
                 wavelengths.",

                 overestimates the later rate of Ca pumping. These

                 Parvalbumin is a slow Ca(2+) buffer that may affect the

                 transients in terminals after an action potential, and

                 Simulation results demonstrate at least four distinct

                 laser line. Second-harmonic imaging microscopy (SHIM)
                 on a laser-scanning system proves, therefore, to be a
                 powerful and unique tool for high-resolution,
                 high-contrast, three-dimensional studies of live cell
                 and tissue architecture. Unlike fluorescence, SHG
                 suffers no inherent photobleaching or toxicity and does
                 not require exogenous labels. Unlike polarization
                 microscopy, SHIM provides intrinsic confocality and
                 deep sectioning in complex tissues. In this study, we
                 demonstrate the clarity of SHIM optical sectioning
                 within unfixed, unstained thick specimens. SHIM and
                 two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) were combined in
                 a dual-mode nonlinear microscopy to elucidate the
                 molecular sources of SHG in live cells and tissues. SHG
                 arose not only from coiled-coil complexes within
                 connective tissues and muscle thick filaments, but also
                 from microtubule arrays within interphase and mitotic
                 cells. Both polarization dependence and a local
                 symmetry cancellation effect of SHG allowed the signal
                 from species generating the second harmonic to be

                 information on local structure below optical
                 resolution. The physical origin of SHG within these
                 tissues is addressed and is attributed to the laser

                 polymerization is accomplished in L. monocytogenes by
                 the bacterial protein ActA. Polystyrene beads coated
                 with purified ActA protein can undergo directional
                 movement in an actin-rich cytoplasmic extract. Thus,
                 the actin polymerization-based motility generated by
                 ActA can be used to move nonbiological cargo, as has

                 self-organize into a polar structure capable of
                 generating unidirectional force. Larger beads (up to 2
                 micrometers in diameter) can initiate movement only if
                 surface asymmetry is introduced by coating the beads on
                 one hemisphere. This explains why the relatively large
                 L. monocytogenes requires polar distribution of ActA on
                 its surface to move.",

                 different extracellular signals to generate specific
                 cytosolic Ca(2+) responses is unknown. In pancreatic

                 evoke cytosolic Ca(2+) spiking by activating common

                 PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P(2) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3).
                 These lipids bind to the pleckstrin homology (PH)
                 domains of proteins and control the activity and
                 subcellular localisation of a diverse array of signal
                 transduction molecules. Three major classes of
                 signalling molecule are regulated by binding of D-3
                 phosphoinositides to PH domains:
                 guanine-nucleotide-exchange proteins for Rho family
                 GTPases, the TEC family tyrosine kinases such as BTK
                 and ITK in B and T lymphocytes, respectively, and the
                 AGC superfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases.
                 These molecules are activated by a variety of
                 extracellular stimuli and have been implicated in a
                 wide range of cellular processes, including cell cycle
                 progression, cell growth, cell motility, cell adhesion

  abstract =     "The reason for the selective vulnerability of motor
                 neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is
                 primarily unknown. A possible factor is the expression
                 by motor neurons of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA/kainate
                 channels, which may permit rapid Ca(2+) influx in
                 response to synaptic receptor activation. However,
                 other subpopulations of central neurons, most notably
                 forebrain GABAergic interneurons, consistently express
                 large numbers of these channels but do not degenerate
                 in ALS. Indeed, when subjected to identical excitotoxic
                 exposures, motor neurons were more susceptible than
                 GABAergic neurons to AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated
                 neurotoxicity. Microfluorimetric studies were performed
                 to examine the basis for the difference in
                 vulnerability. First, AMPA or kainate exposures
                 appeared to trigger substantial mitochondrial Ca(2+)
                 loading in motor neurons, as indicated by a sharp
                 increase in intracellular Ca(2+) after addition of the
                 mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide
                 p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl hydrazone (FCCP) after the
                 agonist exposure. The same exposures caused little
                 mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation in GABAergic cortical
                 neurons. Subsequent experiments examined other measures
                 of mitochondrial function to compare sequelae of
                 AMPA/kainate receptor activation between these
                 populations. Brief exposure to either AMPA or kainate
                 caused mitochondrial depolarization, assessed using
                 tetramethylrhodamine ethylester, and reactive oxygen
                 species (ROS) generation, assessed using hydroethidine,
                 in motor neurons. However, these effects were only seen
                 in the GABAergic neurons after exposure to the
                 nondesensitizing AMPA receptor agonist kainate.
                 Finally, addition of either antioxidants or toxins
                 (FCCP or CN(-)) that block mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake
                 attenuated AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated motor neuron
                 injury, suggesting that the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake
                 and consequent ROS generation are central to the injury
                 process.",

                 an optical section of sample by restricting fluorophore
                 excitation to the plane of focus. High photon
                 densities, achieved only in the focal volume of the
                 objective, are sufficient to excite the fluorescent
                 probe molecules by density-dependent, multiphoton
                 excitation processes. We present comparisons of
                 confocal with multiphoton excitation imaging of
                 identical optical sections within a sample. These
                 side-by-side comparisons of imaging modes demonstrate a
                 significant advantage of multiphoton imaging; data can
                 be obtained from deeper within biological specimens.
                 Observations on a variety of biological samples showed
                 that in all cases there was at least a twofold
                 improvement in the imaging penetration depth obtained
                 with multiphoton excitation relative to confocal
                 imaging. The more pronounced degradation in image
                 contrast deep within a confocally imaged sample is
                 primarily due to scattered emission photons, which
                 reduce the signal and increase the local background as
                 measurements of point spread functions indicated that
                 resolution does not significantly change with
                 increasing depth for either mode of microscopy.
                 Multiphoton imaging does not suffer from degradation of
                 signal-to-background to nearly the same extent as
                 confocal imaging because this method is insensitive to
                 scatter of the emitted signal. Direct detection of
                 emitted photons using an external photodetector mounted
                 close to the objective (possible only in a multiphoton
                 imaging system) improves system sensitivity and the
                 utilization of scattered emission photons for imaging.
                 We demonstrate that this technique provides yet further
                 improvements in the capability of multiphoton
                 excitation imaging to produce good quality images from
                 deeper within tissue relative to confocal imaging.",

                 (FRET) is a powerful technique for measuring molecular
                 interactions at Angstrom distances. We present a new
                 method for FRET that utilizes the unique spectral
                 properties of variants of the green fluorescent protein
                 (GFP) for large-scale analysis by flow cytometry.
                 METHODS: The proteins of interest are fused in frame
                 separately to the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) or the
                 yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). FRET between these
                 differentially tagged fusion proteins is analyzed using
                 a dual-laser FACSVantage cytometer. RESULTS: We show
                 that homotypic interactions between individual receptor
                 chains of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family
                 members can be detected as FRET from CFP-tagged
                 receptor chains to YFP-tagged receptor chains.
                 Noncovalent molecular complexation can be detected as
                 FRET between fusions of CFP and YFP to either the
                 intracellular or extracellular regions of the receptor
                 chains. The specificity of the assay is demonstrated by
                 the absence of FRET between heterologous receptor pairs
                 that do not biochemically associate with each other.
                 Interaction between a TNFR-like receptor
                 (Fas/CD95/Apo-1) and a downstream cytoplasmic signaling
                 component (FADD) can also be demonstrated by flow
                 cytometric FRET analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of
                 spectral variants of GFP in flow cytometric FRET
                 analysis of membrane receptors is demonstrated. This
                 method of analyzing FRET allows probing of noncovalent
                 molecular interactions that involve both the
                 intracellular and extracellular regions of membrane
                 proteins as well as proteins within the cells. Unlike
                 biochemical methods, FRET allows the quantitative
                 determination of noncovalent molecular associations at
                 Angstrom level in living cells. Moreover, flow
                 cytometry allows quantitative analyses to be carried
                 out on a cell-by-cell basis on large number of cells.

                 propanesulfonate (di-4-ANEPPS) that should incorporate

                 segment suggests that the fluorophore is affected by
                 the state of the external pore. In addition, this
                 modulation may reflect conformational changes
                 associated with channel opening that are prevented by
                 tetraethylammonium or agitoxin. Studies of pH
                 titration, collisional quenchers, and anisotropy
                 indicate that fluorophores attached to residues near
                 the S4 segment are constrained by a nearby region of
                 protein. The mechanism of fluorescence quenching near
                 the S4 segment does not involve either reorientation of
                 the fluorophore or a voltage-dependent excitation shift
                 and is different from the quenching mechanism observed
                 at a site near the S2 segment. Taken together, these
                 results suggest that the extracellular portion of the
                 S4 segment resides in an aqueous protein vestibule and
                 is influenced by the state of the external pore.",

                 flow across cell membranes in response to changes in
                 membrane potential. They are made up of four homologous
                 domains or subunits, each of which contains six
                 transmembrane segments. Studies of potassium channels
                 have shown that the second (S2) and fourth (S4)
                 segments contain several charged residues, which sense
                 changes in voltage and form part of the voltage sensor.
                 Although these regions clearly undergo conformational
                 changes in response to voltage, little is known about
                 the nature of these changes because voltage-dependent
                 distance changes have not been measured. Here we use

                 suggest that the region associated with the S4 segment
                 undergoes a rotation and possible tilt, rather than a
                 large transmembrane movement, in response to voltage.

                 of the instantaneous frequency within one ultrashort
                 pulsed emission or quantum beats. In the latter case we
                 determine that the beat pi -phase shift is very fast,

                 sparks) in heart muscle are elementary sarcoplasmic
                 reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-release events. Ca2+ sparks occur
                 at a low rate in quiescent cells but can also be evoked
                 by electrical stimulation of the cell to produce the
                 cell-wide Ca2+ transient. In this study we investigate
                 how Ca2+ sparks are related to propagating waves of
                 elevated cytosolic Ca2+ induced by Ca2+ overload.
                 Single ventricular myocytes from rat were loaded with
                 the Ca(2+)-sensitive indicator fluo 3 and imaged with a
                 confocal microscope. After extracellular Ca2+
                 concentration was increased from 1 to 10 mM to produce
                 Ca2+ overload, the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+
                 sparks, which occur at the t tubule/SR junction,
                 increased approximately 4-fold, whereas the spark
                 amplitude and spatial size increased 4.1-and 1.7-fold,
                 respectively. In addition, a spectrum of larger
                 subcellular events, including propagating Ca2+ waves,
                 was observed. Ca2+ sparks were seen to occur at the
                 majority (65\%) of the sites of wave initiation. For
                 slowly propagating Ca2+ waves, discrete Ca(2+)-release
                 events, similar to Ca2+ sparks, were detected in the
                 wave front. These Ca2+ sparks appeared to recruit other
                 sparks along the wave front so that the wave progressed
                 in a saltatory manner. We conclude that Ca2+ sparks are

                 symmetrical and asymmetrical, from 25 mM to 2 M. I-V
                 curves are nearly linear, in the voltage range +/- 150
                 mV approximately 12kT/e, even in asymmetrical
                 solutions, e.g., 2 M // 100 mM. It is awkward to
                 describe straight lines as sums of exponentials in a
                 wide range of solutions and potentials, and so
                 traditional barrier models have difficulty fitting this
                 data. Diffusion theories with constant fields predict
                 curvilinear I-V relations, and so they are also
                 unsatisfactory. The Poisson and Nernst-Planck equations
                 (PNP) form a diffusion theory with variable fields.
                 They fit the data by using adjustable parameters for
                 the diffusion constant of each ion and for the
                 effective density of fixed (i.e., permanent) charge
                 P(x) along the channel's filter (7-A diameter, 10 A
                 long). If P(x) is described by just one parameter,
                 independent of x (i.e., P(x) = P0 = -4.2 M), the fits
                 are satisfactory (RMS error/RMS current = 6.4/67), and
                 the estimates of diffusion coefficients are reasonable

                 The CRC seems to have a small selectivity filter with a
                 very high density of permanent charge. This may be a
                 design principle of channels specialized for large
                 flux. The Appendix derives barrier models, and their
                 prefactor, from diffusion theories (with variable
                 fields) and argues that barrier models are poor

                 calcium (10-100 microM) near open channels (Ca(local)),
                 followed by a much smaller (<1 microM), longer-lasting
                 residual calcium (Ca(res)). The most prominent
                 component of release, phasic release, lasts several
                 milliseconds and is thought to be triggered by
                 Ca(local). A transient tail of release then continues
                 over the next 20 msec at 1-10\% of peak rates. This
                 transient component of release, which we refer to as
                 TR, is poorly understood, and there is conflicting
                 evidence regarding the role of Ca(local) and Ca(res) in
                 its generation. We used optical methods to monitor
                 Ca(res) and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to
                 study TR at synapses between granule cells and stellate
                 cells in rat cerebellar slices. After stimulation the
                 probability of release is elevated greatly, peaking at
                 500 microseconds and then slowly declining to
                 prestimulus levels after tens of milliseconds. After
                 speeding the decay of Ca(res) levels with EGTA, release
                 is confined to a 3 msec interval, and TR is eliminated.
                 Thus, we find that Ca(res) accounts for a transient
                 tail of release on the millisecond time scale that
                 helps to shape the average synaptic current and
                 accounts for at least 20\% of the synaptic charge in
                 the 20 msec interval after stimulation.
                 Ca(res)-dependent TR is likely to contribute
                 significantly to fast synaptic transmission under
                 physiological conditions, particularly during
                 high-frequency bursts that elevate Ca(res).",

                 advantages and disadvantages and the experimental
                 procedure. The applications of green fluorescent
                 protein (GFP) are even broader. Indeed, the ability to
                 molecularly engineer and recombinantly express a
                 strongly fluorescent probe has provided a powerful tool
                 for investigating a wide variety of biological events
                 in live cells (e.g. tracking of endogenous proteins,
                 labelling of intracellular structures, analysing
                 promoter activity etc.). More recently, the
                 demonstration that, using appropriate mutants and/or
                 fusion proteins, GFP fluorescence can become sensitive

                 expanded its applications and made GFP the favourite
                 probe of cell biologists. We will here present two

                 all-or-none responses. At low concentrations of
                 vasopressin, Ca2+ release was maximal because
                 liberation of additional inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
                 (IP3) by photolysis of its caged precursor at the top
                 of the [Ca2+]i spike failed to increase [Ca2+]i
                 further. However, if IP3 was generated by photolysis of
                 caged IP3 in previously unstimulated cells, [Ca2+]i
                 increased immediately, and the magnitude of the
                 response was a graded function of the quantity of IP3
                 released. We also analyzed the kinetics of activation
                 of intracellular IP3 receptor/Ca2+ channels by
                 monitoring the quench of sequestered dye by the entry
                 of cytoplasmic Mn2+ into fura-2-loaded intracellular
                 IP3-sensitive organelles. This Mn(2+)-induced quench
                 was precipitous and always preceded by a delay
                 inversely related to the vasopressin concentration. In
                 hepatocytes stimulated with 10 nM vasopressin, IP3
                 increased slowly, and the half-time of the IP3 rise was
                 comparable with the latency for the release of
                 intracellular calcium. The slow rise in IP3 would be
                 predicted to produce accelerating Ca2+ release. This is
                 consistent with the results of the Mn2+ quench
                 experiments, which revealed accelerating activation of
                 intracellular IP3-regulated calcium channels. We
                 conclude that this accelerating release of Ca2+, which
                 does not occur with instantaneous increases in IP3 due
                 to flash photolysis, is likely to be important for
                 generating the all-or-none Ca2+ mobilization that

                 microscopy. Numerous biological structures, including
                 stacked membranes and aligned protein structures are
                 highly organized on a nanoscale and have been found to
                 exhibit strong optical activities through

  abstract =     "The dipole potential is an electrical potential within
                 phospholipid membranes, which arises because of the
                 alignment of dipolar residues of the lipids and/or
                 water dipoles in the region between the aqueous phases
                 and the hydrocarbon-like interior of the membrane. For
                 a fully saturated phosphatidylcholine membrane, its
                 value is believed to be in the range 220-280 mV,
                 positive in the membrane interior. This results in an
                 enormous electric field strength within the membrane of
                 10(8)-10(9) Vm(-1). The dipole potential is thus likely
                 to have great significance in controlling the
                 conformation of ion-translocating membrane proteins and
                 so in regulating enzyme function. Because of its
                 location within the membrane, quantification of the
                 dipole potential is extremely difficult and presents a
                 great challenge to the experimentalist and theoretician

                 alone and avoid interference from changes in membrane
                 fluidity. Furthermore, the effect of the dyes
                 themselves on the dipole potential must be
                 investigated. The effect of membrane fluidity on the
                 fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of the
                 dyes RH421 and di-8-ANEPPS have been investigated in

                 temperature-dependent shifts of their excitation
                 spectra, the magnitude of which depend on the emission
                 wavelength and on the lipid structure. In order to

                 dyes has recently been suggested for the measurement of
                 the membrane dipole potential. Up to now only
                 qualititative measurements have been possible. Here the
                 fluorescence excitation ratio of the dye di-8-ANEPPS
                 has been measured in lipid vesicles composed of a range
                 of saturated and unsaturated phosphatidylcholines. It
                 has been found that the fluorescence ratio is inversely
                 proportional to the surface area occupied by the lipid
                 in its fully hydrated state. This finding allows, by
                 extra- and interpolation, the packing density to be
                 estimated of phosphatidylcholines for which X-ray
                 crystallographic data are not yet available. Comparison
                 of the fluorescence data with literature data of the
                 dipole potential from electrical measurements on

                 the dipole potential using di-8-ANEPPS is possible. It
                 has been found that the value of the dipole potential
                 decreases with increasing unsaturation and, in the case
                 of unsaturated lipids, with increasing length of the
                 hydrocarbon chains. This effect can be explained by the
                 effects of chain packing on the spacing between the
                 headgroups. In addition to the effects of lipid
                 structure on membrane fluidity, these measurements

                 studied using

                 l] pyridinium betaine (di-8-ANEPPS) as a fluorescent
                 probe. The dipole potential of phosphatidylcholine
                 membranes was modified by incorporating into the
                 bilayer the sterols phloretin and 6-ketocholestanol
                 (KC), which decrease and increase the dipole potential,
                 respectively. The results derived from the application
                 of a dual-wavelength ratiometric fluorescence method
                 for following the variation of the membrane dipole
                 potential have shown that when p25 inserts into the
                 lipidic bilayer, a decrease in the dipole potential
                 takes place. The magnitude of this decrease depends on
                 the initial value of the dipole potential, i.e., before
                 interaction with the peptide. Thus, when KC was
                 incorporated into the bilayer, the decrease caused by
                 the membrane insertion of p25 was larger than that
                 caused in PC membranes. Alternatively, in the presence
                 of phloretin, the decrease in the potential caused by
                 the peptide insertion was smaller. Complementary
                 studies involving attenuated total reflectance-Fourier
                 transform infrared spectroscopy of the peptide membrane
                 interactions have shown that modification of the dipole
                 potential affects the conformation of the peptide
                 during the course of its interaction with the membrane.
                 The presence of KC induces a higher amount of
                 helicoidal structure. The presence of phloretin,
                 however, does not appear to affect the secondary
                 structure of the peptide. The differences observed in
                 the dipole potential decreases caused by the presence
                 of the peptide with the PC membranes and phloretin-PC
                 membranes, therefore, must involve differences in the

                 matrix. Calibrations and linear ranges are presented

                 capable of modifying the functioning of various
                 membrane-related physiological processes. Here, a
                 fluorescent ratio method using the styrylpyridinium
                 dyes, RH421 and di-8-ANEPPS, was applied to determine
                 the effect of a range of anions and cations on the
                 intramembrane dipole potential of
                 dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles. It was found
                 that certain anions cause a decrease in the dipole
                 potential. This could be explained by binding within
                 the membrane, in support of a hypothesis originally put
                 forward by A. L. Hodgkin and P. Horowicz [1960, J.
                 Physiol. (Lond.) 153:404-412.] The effectiveness of the
                 anions in reducing the dipole potential was found to be
                 ClO4- > SCN- > I- > NO3- > Br- > Cl- > F- > SO42-. This
                 order could be modeled by a partitioning of ions
                 between the membrane and the aqueous phase, which is
                 controlled predominantly by the Gibbs free energy of
                 hydration. Cations were also found to be capable of
                 reducing the dipole potential, although much less
                 efficiently than can anions. The effects of the cations
                 was found to be trivalent > divalent > monovalent. The
                 cation effects were attributed to binding to a specific
                 polar site on the surface of the membrane. The results
                 presented provide a molecular basis for the

                 cytoplasmic Ca in response to Bk were mediated by the
                 B2 receptor subtype. Responses to high concentrations
                 of Bk (1-100 nM) were homogeneous and characterized by
                 a rapidly rising transient that decayed to baseline in
                 the continued presence of agonist, with a half-time of
                 15 s. Responses to low concentrations of Bk (100-500
                 pM) were more heterogeneous, with longer latencies and
                 often with oscillations. Pretreatment with thapsigargin
                 for 20 min prevented the Ca response, showing that the
                 Ca change results from intracellular Ca release.
                 Removal of external Ca had little effect on the
                 response to Bk, indicating that the agonist does not
                 activate Ca influx. The extent of Ca release and
                 refilling after Bk was tested with ionomycin. A
                 saturating dose of Bk (20 nM) mobilizes > 90\% of
                 stored Ca within 30 s, and this is replaced slowly.
                 Replacement of external Na by N-methyl-D-glucamine to
                 block Na/Ca exchange affected the Ca response, causing
                 decreases in latency and in the period of Ca
                 oscillations and increases in overall duration and peak
                 amplitude of the response.",

                 signals in N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells during
                 combined activation of bradykinin (BK) and cholinergic
                 receptors. BK and carbachol (CCh) both activate
                 phospholipase C (PLC) and cause Ca2+ release from
                 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive Ca2+
                 stores. The Ca2+ signal in response to CCh is prolonged
                 by the activation of Ca2+ influx, but BK does not
                 appear to activate the influx pathway. When BK and CCh
                 are applied together (BK+CCh), the Ca2+ response is
                 composed of both Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx. Ca2+
                 influx is also activated by BK+CCh in a subset of cells
                 that does not respond with a intracellular Ca2+
                 concentration increase when CCh is presented by itself.
                 This suggests that CCh stimulates a Ca(2+)-silent
                 cholinergic receptor that is not coupled to Ca2+
                 release but acts synergistically with BK receptors to
                 activate Ca2+ influx. Pertussis toxin reduces influx
                 without affecting release, indicating that the G
                 protein that modulates the influx pathway is different
                 from the G protein responsible for activating PLC.
                 Cholinergic stimulation also causes progressive
                 heterologous desensitization of BK-evoked Ca2+ release.
                 Desensitization has the unique property of continuing
                 to develop after the cholinergic agonist is removed and
                 the cholinergic Ca2+ response has fully recovered.
                 Heterologous desensitization is not the result of Ca2+
                 store depletion or a long-lasting inhibition of PLC or
                 IP3-dependent Ca2+ release. Instead, it appears to
                 involve an early step in the BK-signaling cascade,
                 possibly at the level of the B2 receptor or associated

                 determined from the measured fluxes in the preceding
                 study and incorporated into a model of Ca(2+) dynamics.
                 It was asked if the measured fluxes are sufficient to
                 account for the [Ca(2+)](i) recovery kinetics after
                 depolarization-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) elevations. Ca(2+)
                 transport across the plasma membrane was described by a
                 parallel extrusion/leak system, while the rates of
                 mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake and release were
                 represented using equations like those describing
                 Ca(2+) transport by isolated mitochondria. Taken
                 together, these rate descriptions account very well for
                 the time course of recovery after [Ca(2+)](i)
                 elevations evoked by weak and strong depolarization and
                 their differential sensitivity to FCCP, CGP 37157, and
                 [Na(+)](i). The model also leads to three general
                 conclusions about mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport in
                 intact cells: (1) mitochondria are expected to
                 accumulate Ca(2+) even in response to stimuli that
                 raise [Ca(2+)](i) only slightly above resting levels;
                 (2) there are two qualitatively different stimulus
                 regimes that parallel the buffering and non-buffering
                 modes of Ca(2+) transport by isolated mitochondria that
                 have been described previously; (3) the impact of
                 mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport on intracellular calcium
                 dynamics is strongly influenced by nonmitochondrial
                 Ca(2+) transport; in particular, the magnitude of the
                 prolonged [Ca(2+)](i) elevation that occurs during the
                 plateau phase of recovery is related to the Ca(2+)
                 set-point described in studies of isolated
                 mitochondria, but is a property of mitochondrial Ca(2+)
                 transport in a cellular context. Finally, the model
                 resolves the paradoxical finding that stimulus-induced
                 [Ca(2+)](i) elevations as small as approximately 300 nM
                 increase intramitochondrial total Ca(2+) concentration,
                 but the steady [Ca(2+)](i) elevations evoked by such
                 stimuli are not influenced by FCCP.",

                 Cells were treated with thapsigargin to inhibit Ca(2+)
                 accumulation by SERCA pumps and depolarized to elevate
                 [Ca(2+)](i); the recovery that followed repolarization
                 was then examined. The total Ca(2+) flux responsible
                 for the [Ca(2+)](i) recovery was separated into
                 mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial components based on
                 sensitivity to the proton ionophore FCCP, a selective
                 inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport in these
                 cells. The nonmitochondrial flux, representing net
                 Ca(2+) extrusion across the plasma membrane, has a
                 simple dependence on [Ca(2+)](i), while the net
                 mitochondrial flux (J(mito)) is biphasic, indicative of
                 Ca(2+) accumulation during the initial phase of
                 recovery when [Ca(2+)](i) is high, and net Ca(2+)
                 release during later phases of recovery. During each
                 phase, mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport has distinct
                 effects on recovery kinetics. J(mito) was separated
                 into components representing mitochondrial Ca(2+)
                 uptake and release based on sensitivity to the specific
                 mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibitor, CGP
                 37157 (CGP). The CGP-resistant (uptake) component of
                 J(mito) increases steeply with [Ca(2+)](i), as expected
                 for transport by the mitochondrial uniporter. The
                 CGP-sensitive (release) component is inhibited by
                 lowering the intracellular Na(+) concentration and
                 depends on both intra- and extramitochondrial Ca(2+)
                 concentration, as expected for the Na(+)/Ca(2+)
                 exchanger. Above approximately 400 nM [Ca(2+)](i), net
                 mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport is dominated by uptake
                 and is largely insensitive to CGP. When [Ca(2+)](i) is
                 approximately 200-300 nM, the net mitochondrial flux is
                 small but represents the sum of much larger uptake and
                 release fluxes that largely cancel. Thus, mitochondrial
                 Ca(2+) transport occurs in situ at much lower
                 concentrations than previously thought, and may provide
                 a mechanism for quantitative control of ATP production
                 after brief or low frequency stimuli that raise
                 [Ca(2+)](i) to levels below approximately 500 nM.",

  abstract =     "Using confocal imaging of Rhod-2-loaded HeLa cells, we
                 examined the ability of mitochondria to sequester
                 Ca(2+) signals arising from different sources.
                 Mitochondrial Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)mit) uptake was stimulated
                 by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3))-evoked Ca(2+)
                 release, capacitative Ca(2+) entry, and Ca(2+) leaking
                 from the endoplasmic reticulum. For each Ca(2+) source,
                 the relationship between cytosolic Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)cyt)
                 concentration and Ca(2+)mit was complex. With Ca(2+)cyt
                 < 300 nm, a slow and persistent Ca(2+)mit uptake was
                 observed. If Ca(2+)cyt increased above approximately
                 400 nm, Ca(2+)mit uptake accelerated sharply. For
                 equivalent Ca(2+)cyt increases, the rate of Ca(2+)mit
                 rise was greater with InsP(3)-evoked Ca(2+) signals
                 than any other source. Spatial variation of the
                 Ca(2+)mit response was observed within individual
                 cells. Both the fraction of responsive mitochondria and
                 the amplitude of the Ca(2+)mit response were graded in
                 direct proportion to stimulus concentration. Trains of
                 repetitive Ca(2+) oscillations did not maintain
                 elevated Ca(2+)mit levels. Only low frequency Ca(2+)
                 transients (<1/15 min) evoked repetitive Ca(2+)mit
                 signals. Our data indicate that there is a lag between
                 Ca(2+)cyt and Ca(2+)mit increases but that mitochondria
                 will accumulate calcium when it is elevated over basal
                 levels regardless of its source. Furthermore, in
                 addition to the characteristics of Ca(2+) signals,
                 Ca(2+) uniporter desensitization and proximity of
                 mitochondria to InsP(3) receptors modulate
                 mitochondrial Ca(2+) responses.",

                 and non-linear optical (NLO) properties is exploited
                 with regard to materials for use in second-harmonic
                 generation (SHG). A bond-length-alternation (BLA) study
                 is performed on all available crystal structures of
                 tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) derivatives in order to
                 predict better SHG contenders. This builds upon a
                 previous bond-length-alternation study that was carried
                 out on a series of TCNQ derivatives. There, a formalism
                 was derived to calculate the relative level of
                 delocalisation within the central TCNQ fragment and
                 relate this to the molecular hyperpolarizability, §,
                 the measure of the SHG coefficient on the molecular
                 scale. This formalism is based upon the strengthÐlength
                 relationship in bonds that has been validated via a
                 charge-density study on one of these TCNQ derivatives
                 using a topological approach. The results of the study
                 are grouped according to the relative levels of
                 delocalisation present in each molecule and compared
                 with known SHG contenders. The promise of TCNQ
                 derivatives for non-linear optics lies partly in their
                 typically high molecular dipole moments, µ. However,
                 large values of µ usually force the molecules to pack
                 centrosymmetrically in a crystalline environment since
                 the dipoles oppose each other in close proximity, and
                 centrosymmetry precludes any SHG effect since this
                 property is a third-rank tensor. A strategy for forming
                 these materials in a solid-state head-to-tail
                 arrangement that is regular but not crystalline is
                 therefore highly desirable. A feasibility study on the
                 adsorption of a TCNQ derivative into zeolite, ZSM-5,
                 shows that this objective may be achievable in this
                 class of materials, thus providing a mechanism for
                 realizing the potential of highly SHG-active materials
                 identified in the bond-length-alternation study.",

                 mitochondrially targeted DsRed1 or calcein. The

                 cortical astrocytes and neuronal cells all displayed
                 heterogeneous distributions and were of varying sizes.
                 There was a denser aggregation of mitochondria in
                 perinuclear positions than in the cell periphery, where
                 individual isolated mitochondria could be seen clearly.
                 Using fluorescence-recovery after photobleaching, we
                 observed that DsRed1 and calcein were highly mobile
                 within the matrix of individual mitochondria, and that
                 mitochondria within a cell were not lumenally

                 It also provides a simple method for writing the

                 limited to the paraxial ray approximation, but aplly to

                 0.1 microM fluo-3. Acquisition of line-scan images on a
                 laser scanning confocal microscope was synchronized
                 with measurement of Cd2+-sensitive Ca2+ currents. In
                 most cells, individual Ca2+ sparks were observed by
                 reducing Ca2+ current density with nifedipine (0.1-8
                 microM). 2. Ca2+ sparks elicited by depolarizing
                 voltage-clamp pulses had a peak [Ca2+] amplitude of 289
                 +/- 3 nM with a decay half-time of 20.8 +/- 0.2 ms and
                 a full width at half-maximum of 1.40 +/- 0.03 microm
                 (mean +/-s. e.m., n = 345), independent of the membrane
                 potential. 3. The time between the beginning of a
                 depolarization and the initiation of each Ca2+ spark
                 was calculated and data were pooled to construct
                 waiting time histograms. Exponential functions were
                 fitted to these histograms and to the decaying phase of
                 the Ca2+ current. This analysis showed that the time
                 constants describing Ca2+ current and Ca2+ spark
                 occurrence at membrane potentials between -30 mV and
                 +30 mV were not significantly different. At +50 mV, in
                 the absence of nifedipine, the time constant describing
                 Ca2+ spark occurrence was significantly larger than the
                 time constant of the Ca2+ current. 4. A simple model is
                 developed using Poisson statistics to relate
                 macroscopic Ca2+ current to the opening of single
                 L-type Ca2+ channels at the dyad junction and to the
                 time course of Ca2+ spark occurrence. The model
                 suggests that the time courses of macroscopic Ca2+
                 current and Ca2+ spark occurrence should be closely
                 related when opening of a single L-type Ca2+ channel
                 initiates a Ca2+ spark. By comparison with the data,
                 the model suggests that Ca2+ sparks are initiated by
                 the opening of a single L-type Ca2+ channel at all
                 membrane potentials encountered during an action

                 protocol for LTP, a 1-s, 50-Hz tetanus, generates Ca2+
                 increases of about 50-Hz in dendritic spines of CA1
                 neurons. These very large increases, measured using a
                 low affinity indicator (Mg fura 5), were found only in
                 the spines and tertiary dendrites, and were dependent
                 upon influx through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) gated
                 channels. High affinity Ca2+ indicators (e.g., fura 2)
                 are unable to demonstrate these events. In acute
                 slices, neighboring dendritic branches often showed
                 very different responses to a tetanus, and in some
                 instances, neighboring spines on the same dendrite
                 responded differently. LTD in mature CA1 neurons was
                 induced by a low frequency stimulus protocol (2 Hz, 900
                 pulses), in the presence of GABA-and NMDA-receptor
                 blockers. This LTD protocol produced dendritic Ca2+
                 increases of <1 microM. Duration of the Ca2+ increase
                 was approximately 30 s and was due to voltage-gated

                 and Ca2+ sparks in isolated adult rabbit Purkinje cells
                 were examined using confocal microscopy and the Ca2+
                 indicator fluo-3. 2.When cells were field stimulated in
                 2.0 mM Ca2+ buffer, a transverse confocal line scan
                 (500 Hz) showed that the fluorescence intensity was
                 greatest at the cell periphery during the onset of the
                 Ca2+ transient ([Ca2+]i). In contrast, the [Ca2+]i of
                 ventricular cells showed a more uniform pattern of
                 activation across the cell. Staining with di-8-ANEPPS
                 revealed that Purkinje cells lack t-tubules, whereas
                 ventricular cells have an extensive t-tubular system.
                 3.When we superfused both cell types with a buffer
                 containing 5 mM Ca2+-1 microM isoproterenol
                 (isoprenaline) they produced Ca2+ sparks spontaneously.
                 Ca2+ sparks occurred only at the periphery of Purkinje
                 cells but occurred throughout ventricular cells. Sparks
                 in both cell types could be completely abolished by
                 addition of the SR inhibitor thapsigargin (500 nM).
                 Brief exposure to nifedipine (10 microM) did not reduce
                 the number of spontaneous sparks. 4.Immunofluorescence
                 staining of Purkinje cells with anti-ryanodine antibody
                 revealed that ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are present at
                 both peripheral and central locations. 5.Computer
                 simulations of experiments in which the calcium
                 transient was evoked by voltage clamp depolarizations
                 suggested that the increase in calcium observed in the
                 centre of the cell could be explained by simple
                 buffered diffusion of calcium. These computations
                 suggested that the RyRs deep within the cell do not
                 contribute significantly to the calcium transient.
                 6.These results provide the first detailed, spatially
                 resolved data describing Ca2+ transients and Ca2+
                 sparks in rabbit cardiac Purkinje cells. Both types of
                 events are initiated only at subsarcolemmal SR Ca2+
                 release sites suggesting that in Purkinje cells, Ca2+
                 sparks only originate where the sarcolemma and
                 sarcoplasmic reticulum form junctions. The role of the
                 centrally located RyRs remains unclear. It is possible
                 that because of the lack of t-tubules these RyRs do not
                 experience a sufficiently large Ca2+ trigger during
                 excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling to become

                 thought to affect activity-dependent synaptic
                 plasticity associated with learning and memory. Large
                 Ca(2+) transients have been implicated in the induction
                 of long-term potentiation (LTP), while smaller Ca(2+)
                 transients have been associated with long-term
                 depression (LTD). However, a direct relationship has
                 not been demonstrated between Ca(2+) measurements and
                 direction of synaptic plasticity in the same cells,
                 using one induction protocol. Here, we used glutamate
                 iontophoresis to induce Ca(2+) transients in
                 hippocampal CA1 neurons injected with the
                 Ca(2+)-indicator fura-2. Test stimulation of one or two
                 synaptic pathways before and after iontophoresis showed
                 that the direction of synaptic plasticity correlated
                 with glutamate-induced Ca(2+) levels above a threshold,
                 below which no plasticity occurred (~180 nM).
                 Relatively low Ca(2+) levels (180-500 nM) typically led
                 to LTD of synaptic transmission and higher levels (>500
                 nM) often led to LTP. Failure to show plasticity
                 correlated with Ca(2+) levels in two distinct ranges:
                 <180 nM and ~450-600 nM, while only LTD occurred
                 between these ranges. Our data support a class of
                 models in which failure of Ca(2+) transients to affect
                 transmission may arise either from insufficient Ca(2+)
                 to affect Ca(2+)-sensitive proteins regulating synaptic
                 strength through opposing activities or from higher
                 Ca(2+) levels that reset activities of such proteins
                 without affecting the net balance of activities. Our
                 estimates of the threshold Ca(2+) level for LTD (~180
                 nM) and for the transition from LTD to LTP (~540 nM)
                 may assist in constraining the molecular details of
                 such models.",

                 significant probability of the electron returning to

                 diffusible second messenger mediating suppression of M
                 current via G protein-coupled receptors has not been
                 identified. In superior cervical ganglion neurons, we
                 find that the signaling pathways underlying M current
                 inhibition by B2 bradykinin and M1 muscarinic receptors
                 respond very differently to inhibitors. The bradykinin
                 pathway was suppressed by the phospholipase C inhibitor
                 U-73122, by blocking the IP3 receptor with pentosan
                 polysulfate or heparin, and by buffering intracellular
                 calcium, and it was occluded by allowing IP3 to diffuse
                 into the cytoplasm via a patch pipette. By contrast,
                 the muscarinic pathway was not disrupted by any of
                 these treatments. The addition of bradykinin was
                 accompanied by a [Ca2+]i rise with a similar onset and
                 time to peak as the inhibition of M current. The M
                 current inhibition and the rise of [Ca2+]i were blocked
                 by depletion of Ca2+ internal stores by thapsigargin.
                 We conclude that bradykinin receptors inhibit M current
                 of sympathetic neurons by activating phospholipase C
                 and releasing Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores,
                 whereas muscarinic receptors do not use the

                 alters the dipole potential of lipid monolayers and
                 bilayers. Its adsorption to biological and artificial
                 membranes results in a change of the membrane
                 permeability for a variety of charged and neutral
                 compounds. In this respect phloretin represents a model
                 substance to study the effect of dipole potentials on
                 membrane permeability. In this investigation we studied
                 the interaction of phloretin with monolayers formed of
                 different lipids in the liquid-expanded and the
                 condensed state. Phloretin integrated into the
                 monolayers as a function of the aqueous concentration
                 of its neutral form, indicated by an increase of the
                 surface pressure in the presence of phloretin.
                 Simultaneous recording of the surface potential of the
                 monolayers allowed us to correlate the degree of
                 phloretin integration and the phloretin-induced dipole
                 potential change. Increasing the surface pressure
                 decreased the phloretin-induced shift of the isotherms,
                 but did not influence the phloretin-induced surface
                 potential change. This means that phloretin adsorption
                 to the lipid surface can occur without affecting the
                 lipid packing. The surface potential effect of
                 phloretin is accompanied by a change of the lipid
                 dipole moment vector dependent on the lipid packing.
                 This means that the relation between the surface
                 potential change and the lipid packing cannot be
                 described by a static model alone. Taking into account
                 the deviations of the surface potential change versus
                 molecular area isotherms of the experimental data to
                 the theoretically predicted course, we propose a model
                 that relates the area change to the dipole moment in a
                 dynamic manner. By using this model the experimental
                 data can be described much better than with a static

                 Ca(2+)release channels (IP(3)R) and mitochondrial
                 Ca(2+)uptake sites, and displays functional
                 similarities to synaptic transmission. Activation of
                 IP(3)R by IP(3)is known to evoke quantal
                 Ca(2+)mobilization that is associated with incremental
                 elevations of mitochondrial matrix [Ca(2+)]
                 ([Ca(2+)](m)). Here we report that activation of IP(3)R
                 by adenophostin-A (AP) yields non-quantal
                 Ca(2+)mobilization in mast cells. We also show that the
                 AP-induced continuous Ca(2+)release causes relatively
                 small [Ca(2+)](m)responses, in particular, the
                 sustained phase of Ca(2+)release is not sensed by the
                 mitochondria. Inhibition of ER Ca(2+)pumps by
                 thapsigargin slightly increases IP(3)-induced
                 [Ca(2+)](m)responses, but augments AP-induced
                 [Ca(2+)](m)responses in a large extent. In adherent
                 permeabilized cells exposed to elevated [Ca(2+)], ER
                 Ca(2+)uptake fails to affect global cytosolic [Ca(2+)],
                 but attenuates [Ca(2+)](m)responses. Moreover, almost
                 every mitochondrion exhibits a region very close to ER
                 Ca(2+)pumps visualized by BODIPY-FL-thapsigargin or

                 oscillations into the mitochondrial matrix is thought
                 to be supported by local calcium control between IP3
                 receptor Ca2+ channels (IP3R) and mitochondria, but
                 study of the coupling mechanisms has been difficult. We
                 established a permeabilized cell model in which the
                 Ca2+ coupling between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
                 mitochondria is retained, and mitochondrial [Ca2+]
                 ([Ca2+]m) can be monitored by fluorescence imaging. We
                 demonstrate that maximal activation of mitochondrial
                 Ca2+ uptake is evoked by IP3-induced perimitochondrial
                 [Ca2+] elevations, which appear to reach values
                 >20-fold higher than the global increases of [Ca2+]c.
                 Incremental doses of IP3 elicited [Ca2+]m elevations
                 that followed the quantal pattern of Ca2+ mobilization,
                 even at the level of individual mitochondria. In
                 contrast, gradual increases of IP3 evoked relatively
                 small [Ca2+]m responses despite eliciting similar
                 [Ca2+]c increases. We conclude that each mitochondrial
                 Ca2+ uptake site faces multiple IP3R, a concurrent
                 activation of which is required for optimal activation
                 of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. This architecture
                 explains why calcium oscillations evoked by
                 synchronized periodic activation of IP3R are
                 particularly effective in establishing dynamic control
                 over mitochondrial metabolism. Furthermore, our data
                 reveal fundamental functional similarities between
                 ER-mitochondrial Ca2+ coupling and synaptic
                 transmission.",

                 produced by physiological stimulation of lizard motor
                 nerve terminals. During repetitive action potential
                 discharge at 10-50 Hz, the increase in average
                 cytosolic [Ca(2+)] reached plateau at levels that
                 increased with increasing stimulus frequency. This
                 stabilization of cytosolic [Ca(2+)] was caused mainly
                 by mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, because drugs that
                 depolarize mitochondria greatly increased the
                 stimulation-induced elevation of cytosolic [Ca(2+)],
                 whereas blockers of other Ca(2+) clearance routes had
                 little effect. Surprisingly, during this sustained
                 Ca(2+) uptake the free [Ca(2+)] in the mitochondrial
                 matrix never exceeded a plateau level of approximately
                 1 microM, regardless of stimulation frequency or
                 pattern. When stimulation ceased, matrix [Ca(2+)]
                 decreased over a slow ( approximately 10 min) time
                 course consisting of an initial plateau followed by a
                 return to baseline. These measurements demonstrate that
                 sustained mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake is not invariably
                 accompanied by progressive elevation of matrix free
                 [Ca(2+)]. Both the plateau of matrix free [Ca(2+)]
                 during stimulation and its complex decay after

                 incorporating reversible formation of an insoluble Ca
                 salt. This mechanism allows mitochondria to sequester
                 large amounts of Ca(2+) while maintaining matrix free
                 [Ca(2+)] at levels sufficient to activate
                 Ca(2+)-dependent mitochondrial dehydrogenases, but

                 field by explicitly accounting for the ionic
                 composition of the electroporation current. The
                 previous model with non-specific electroporation
                 current predicts that both the transmembrane potential
                 V(m) and the pore density N are symmetric about the
                 equator, with the same values at either end of the
                 cell. The new, ion-specific case predicts that V(m) is
                 symmetric and almost identical to the profile from the
                 non-specific case, but N has a profound asymmetry with
                 the pore density at the hyperpolarized end of the cell
                 twice the value at the depolarized end. These modeling

                 rest potential on the transmembrane potential V(m) and
                 pore density N around the cell. As compared to the
                 induced potential predicted by resistive-capacitive
                 theory, the model of electroporation predicts a smaller
                 magnitude of V(m) throughout the cell. Both V(m) and N
                 are symmetric about the equator with the same value at
                 both poles of the cell. Larger shocks do not increase
                 the maximum magnitude of V(m) because more pores form
                 to shunt the excess stimulus current across the
                 membrane. In addition, the value of the rest potential
                 does not affect V(m) around the cell because the
                 electroporation current is several orders of magnitude
                 larger than the ionic current that supports the rest

                 in the membrane for several seconds. Complete resealing

                 specific for a wide variety of small molecule ligands.
                 bPBPs undergo a large, ligand-mediated conformational
                 change that can be linked to reporter functions to
                 monitor ligand concentrations. This mechanism provides
                 the basis of a general system for engineering families
                 of reagentless biosensors that share a common physical
                 signal transduction functionality and detect many
                 different analytes. We demonstrate the facility of
                 designing optical biosensors based on fluorophore
                 conjugates using 8 environmentally sensitive
                 fluorophores and 11 bPBPs specific for diverse ligands,
                 including sugars, amino acids, anions, cations, and
                 dipeptides. Construction of reagentless fluorescent
                 biosensors relies on identification of sites that
                 undergo a local conformational change in concert with
                 the global, ligand-mediated hinge-bending motion.
                 Construction of cysteine mutations at these locations
                 then permits site-specific coupling of environmentally
                 sensitive fluorophores that report ligand binding as
                 changes in fluorescence intensity. For 10 of the bPBPs
                 presented in this study, the three-dimensional receptor

                 Gating (FROG), that succeeds in measuring the full
                 intensity and phase evolution of an individual,
                 arbitrary ultrashort pulse. In brief, FROG involves
                 measuring the pulse spectrogram, i.e., the spectrum of
                 the signal pulse in an auto- or cross-correlation using
                 any instantaneous nonlinearity, yielding signal
                 intensity vs. delay and frequency. This trace can then
                 be shown to fully and uniquely characterize the
                 pulse-the pulse extraction problem is equivalent to
                 two-dimensional phase retrieval, a solved problem from
                 image science. In the work with lower-intensity pulses
                 the authors utilize (multi-shot) self-diffraction (SD)
                 and second-harmonic-generation (SHG) FROG arrangements,

                 optimization, generalized projections,
                 Weiner-filtering, and a variety of other techniques.
                 The authors report significantly improved performance,
                 especially for SHG FROG. They have also performed an

                 a simple method for checking the consistency of

                 independently measured spectrum and autocorrelation of

                 determine the optimum sampling rate for FROG and show
                 that this satisfies the Nyquist criterion for the laser
                 pulse. We explore the low- and high-power limits to

                 call experiments in computo. The use of realistic
                 models makes it possible to generate new predictions
                 that can be confirmed experimentally. Several examples
                 are given of how this approach has improved our
                 understanding of synaptic integration by the Purkinje
                 cell active dendrite. The computer model was
                 constructed to replicate neuronal behavior which has no
                 direct relevance to synaptic integration: it was tuned
                 to reproduce the response of Purkinje cells to current
                 injection in vitro, which consists of a high frequency,
                 regular rhythm of somatic Na+ spikes, interrupted by
                 spontaneous dendritic Ca2+ spikes. The in vivo firing
                 behavior of Purkinje cells is quite different as it
                 consists of highly irregular simple spike firing only,
                 without spontaneous dendritic Ca2+ spikes. The computer
                 model predicted-that the Purkinje cell needs to receive
                 a continuous background inhibitory synaptic drive in
                 addition to the excitation by parallel fibers to obtain
                 this typical in vivo firing. This prediction was
                 confirmed by blocking inhibition during in vivo
                 intracellular recordings. More recently, we
                 demonstrated that the net inhibitory drive to the
                 Purkinje cell dendrite has to be larger than the
                 excitatory synaptic drive. Inhibition hyperpolarizes
                 the dendrite compared to the soma, making it act as a
                 current sink during most of the spiking cycle. These
                 predictions have been confirmed with the dynamic clamp
                 method in the cerebellar slice preparation. Synchronous
                 focal excitatory input by parallel fiber leads in the
                 model to activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
                 which amplify the somatic response by a variable
                 amount. The variability of this graded amplification is
                 due both to position of the input, effectively
                 canceling the cable attenuation, and to the effect of
                 preceding background input. Differences between the
                 model and experimental results in this aspect can be
                 explained by the relative hyperpolarized state of
                 Purkinje cells in the in vitro experimental
                 preparation. These studies led to a new theory about
                 the function of long-term depression in the cerebellum
                 which can explain recent experimental results. In
                 conclusion, our modeling approach generated predictions
                 which contradicted prevalent ideas on how the
                 cerebellum, or neurons in general, works and led to
                 experiments which otherwise would not have been carried
                 out.",

                 therapy (etoposide, doxorubicin,
                 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine), as well as the
                 proapoptotic second messenger ceramide, induce a
                 disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential
                 (delta psi m) that precedes nuclear DNA fragmentation.
                 This effect has been observed in tumor cell lines of
                 T-lymphoid, B-lymphoid, and myelomonocytic origin in
                 vitro. Circulating tumor cells from patients receiving
                 chemotherapy in vivo also demonstrate a delta psi m
                 disruption after in vitro culture that precedes nuclear
                 apoptosis. Transfection-enforced hyperexpression of the
                 proto-oncogenes bcl-2 and bcl-XL protects against
                 chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, at both the level of
                 the mitochondrial dysfunction preceding nuclear
                 apoptosis and the level of late nuclear apoptotic
                 events. Bcl-2-mediated inhibition of ceramide-induced
                 delta psi m disruption is observed in normal as well as
                 anucleate cells, indicating that bcl-2 acts on an
                 extranuclear pathway of apoptosis. In contrast to Bcl-2
                 and Bcl-XL, hyperexpression of the protease inhibitor
                 cytokine response modifier A fails to protect tumor
                 cells against chemotherapy-induced delta psi m
                 disruption and apoptosis, although cytokine response
                 modifier A does prevent the delta psi m collapse and
                 posterior nuclear apoptosis triggered by cross-linking
                 of Fas/Apo-1/CD95. In conclusion, delta psi m
                 disruption seems to be an obligatory step of early
                 (pre-nuclear) apoptosis, and delta psi m is stabilized
                 by two members of the bcl-2 gene family conferring
                 resistance to chemotherapy.",

                 imaging and photo-activation ('uncaging') of bioactive
                 compounds from inactive ('caged') precursors in intact
                 and semi-intact nervous systems. Optical methods based

                 the authors show a range of imaging modes based on

  abstract =     "Sensory processing and its perception require that
                 local information would also be available globally.
                 Indeed, in the mammalian neocortex, local excitation
                 spreads over large distances via the long-range
                 horizontal connections in layer 2/3 and may spread over
                 an entire cortical area if excitatory polysynaptic
                 pathways are also activated. Therefore, a balance
                 between local excitation and surround inhibition is
                 required. Here we explore the spatiotemporal aspects of
                 cortical depolarization and hyperpolarization of rats
                 anesthetized with urethane. New voltage-sensitive dyes
                 (VSDs) were used for high-resolution real-time
                 visualization of the cortical responses to whisker
                 deflections and cutaneous stimulations of the whisker
                 pad. These advances facilitated imaging of ongoing
                 activity and evoked responses even without signal
                 averaging. We found that the motion of a single whisker
                 evoked a cortical response exhibiting either one or
                 three phases. During a triphasic response, there was
                 first a cortical depolarization in a small cortical
                 region the size of a single cortical barrel.
                 Subsequently, this depolarization increased and spread
                 laterally in an oval manner, preferentially along rows
                 of the barrel field. During the second phase, the
                 amplitude of the evoked response declined rapidly,
                 presumably because of recurrent inhibition.
                 Subsequently, the third phase exhibiting a
                 depolarization rebound was observed and clear, and
                 approximately 16 Hz oscillations were detected.
                 Stimulus conditions revealing a net surround
                 hyperpolarization during the second phase were also
                 found. By using new, improved VSD, the present findings
                 shed new light on the spatial parameters of the
                 intricate spatiotemporal cortical interplay of
                 inhibition and excitation.",

  abstract =     "1. The relation between mitochondrial membrane
                 potential (delta psi m) and cell function was
                 investigated in single adult rat cardiac myocytes
                 during anoxia and reoxygenation. delta psi m was
                 studied by loading myocytes with JC-1
                 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetra-ethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine
                 iodide), a fluorescent probe characterized by two
                 emission peaks (539 and 597 nm with excitation at 490
                 nm) corresponding to monomer and aggregate forms of the
                 dye. 2. De-energizing conditions applied to
                 mitochondria, cell suspensions or single cells
                 decreased the aggregate emission and increased the
                 monomer emission. This latter result cannot be
                 explained by changes of JC-1 concentration in the
                 aqueous mitochondrial matrix phase indicating that
                 hydrophobic interaction of the probe with membranes has
                 to be taken into account to explain JC-1 fluorescence
                 properties in isolated mitochondria or intact cells. 3.
                 A different sensitivity of the two JC-1 forms to delta
                 psi m changes was shown in isolated mitochondria by the
                 effects of ADP and FCCP and the calibration with K+
                 diffusion potentials. The monomer emission was
                 responsive to values of delta psi m below 140 mV, which
                 hardly modified the aggregate emission. Thus JC-1
                 represents a unique double sensor which can provide
                 semi-quantitative information in both low and high
                 potential ranges. 4. At the onset of glucose-free
                 anoxia the epifluorescence of individual myocytes
                 studied in the single excitation (490 nm)-double
                 emission (530 and 590 nm) mode showed a gradual decline
                 of the aggregate emission, which reached a plateau
                 while electrically stimulated (0.2 Hz) contraction was
                 still retained. The subsequent failure of contraction
                 was followed by the rise of the emission at 530 nm,
                 corresponding to the monomer form of the dye,
                 concomitantly with the development of rigor
                 contracture. 5. The onset of the rigor was preceded by
                 the increase in intracellular Mg2+ concentration
                 ([Mg2+]i) monitored by mag-indo-1 epifluorescence.
                 Since under these experimental conditions intracellular
                 [Ca2+] and pH are fairly stable, the increase in
                 [Mg2+]i was likely to be produced by a decrease in ATP
                 content. 6. The inhibition of mitochondrial ATPase
                 induced by oligomycin during anoxia was associated with
                 a rapid and simultaneous change of both the components
                 of JC-1 fluorescence, suggesting that delta psi m,
                 instead of producing ATP, is generated by glycolytic
                 ATP during anoxia. 7. The readmission of oxygen induced
                 a rapid decrease of the monomer emission and a slower
                 increase of the aggregate emission. These fluorescence
                 changes were not necessarily associated with the
                 recovery of mechanical function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

                 calcium-overloaded voltage-clamped rat ventricular
                 myocytes loaded with the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent
                 indicator indo-1. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+
                 content was measured from the integral of the
                 caffeine-evoked current. In cells that had spontaneous
                 SR Ca2+ release in 1 mM external Ca2+ concentration
                 ([Ca2+]o)i raising [Ca2+]o increased the frequency of
                 release with no effect on SR Ca2+ content. In quiescent
                 cells, increased [Ca2+]o produced spontaneous Ca2+
                 release associated with increased SR Ca2+ content.
                 Further increase of [Ca2+]o had no effect on SR Ca2+
                 content. The amount of Ca2+ leaving the cell during
                 each release was constant over a wide range of
                 frequencies and [Ca2+]o values. It appears there is a
                 maximum level of SR Ca2+ content, perhaps because
                 spontaneous Ca2+ release results when the content
                 reaches a threshold. 2. From the relationship between
                 [Ca2+]i and Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange current during a
                 caffeine response, it is possible to estimate the
                 changes in Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange current expected from a
                 change of [Ca2+]i. The data show that the calcium
                 oscillations contribute a significant fraction of the
                 total extra Ca2+ efflux induced by increasing [Ca2+]o.
                 Raising [Ca2+]o decreased the rate of calcium removal
                 from the cell as measured from the rate of decay of the
                 caffeine response, suggesting that both inhibition of
                 Ca2+ efflux and increased Ca2+ entry account for the
                 Ca2+ overload at elevated [Ca2+]o. 3. Inhibiting
                 spontaneous SR Ca2+ release increases resting [Ca2+]i.
                 The Ca2+ efflux is identical to that in the presence of
                 release. It is concluded that spontaneous release of
                 calcium, although potentially arrhythmogenic, is an
                 effective way to activate Ca2+ efflux in overloaded
                 conditions and minimizes any increase of diastolic
                 tension.",

                 biological systems unobscured by ensemble averaging.
                 Here we present a study of the photophysical behaviour
                 of single molecules of the green fluorescent protein
                 (GFP) derived from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria.
                 Wild-type GFP and its mutant have attracted interest as
                 fluorescent biological labels because the fluorophore
                 may be formed in vivo. GFP mutants immobilized in
                 aereated aqueous polymer gels and excited by 488-nm
                 light undergo repeated cycles of fluorescent emission
                 ('blinking') on a timescale of several
                 seconds-behaviour that would be unobservable in bulk
                 studies. Eventually the individual GFP molecules reach
                 a long-lasting dark state, from which they can be
                 switched back to the original emissive state by
                 irradiation at 405 nm. This suggests the possibility of
                 using these GFPs as fluorescent markers for
                 time-dependent cell processes, and as molecular
                 photonic switches or optical storage elements,

                 during repetitive use. Different types of synapses
                 exhibit distinctive synaptic plasticity, but the
                 factors giving rise to such diversity are not fully
                 understood. To provide the experimental basis for a
                 general model of short-term plasticity, we studied
                 three synapses in rat brain slices at 34 degrees C: the
                 climbing fiber to Purkinje cell synapse, the parallel
                 fiber to Purkinje cell synapse, and the Schaffer
                 collateral to CA1 pyramidal cell synapse. These
                 synapses exhibited a broad range of responses to
                 regular and Poisson stimulus trains. Depression
                 dominated at the climbing fiber synapse, facilitation
                 was prominent at the parallel fiber synapse, and both
                 depression and facilitation were apparent in the
                 Schaffer collateral synapse. These synapses were
                 modeled by incorporating mechanisms of short-term
                 plasticity that are known to be driven by residual
                 presynaptic calcium (Ca(res)). In our model, release is
                 the product of two factors: facilitation and refractory
                 depression. Facilitation is caused by a
                 calcium-dependent increase in the probability of
                 release. Refractory depression is a consequence of
                 release sites becoming transiently ineffective after
                 release. These sites recover with a time course that is
                 accelerated by elevations of Ca(res). Facilitation and
                 refractory depression are coupled by their common
                 dependence on Ca(res) and because increased transmitter
                 release leads to greater synaptic depression. This
                 model captures the behavior of three different synapses
                 for various stimulus conditions. The interplay of
                 facilitation and depression dictates synaptic strength
                 and variability during repetitive activation. The
                 resulting synaptic plasticity transforms the timing of
                 presynaptic spikes into varying postsynaptic response
                 amplitudes.",

                 potential was studied in a preparation of sealed SL
                 vesicles. Membrane potential was imposed by
                 preincubating the vesicles in media of defined ion
                 composition (K+, Cl-, choline+ and gluconate+) and
                 diluting into media of differing ion composition. The

                 permeabilities were determined in separate experiments
                 by the dependence of the half time for net K+ (or
                 choline+) movement coupled with these anions (Cl- or
                 gluconate-), registered by the fluorescence of
                 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (Chiu, V.C.K.,
                 Haynes, D.H. 1980. J. Membrane Biol. 56:203-218).
                 Relative permeabilities were: 1.0, K+; .gtoreq.10.0, 1
                 .mu.M valinomycin-K+; 4.0, Cl-; 0.66, choline+; 0.38,
                 gluconate-. Durations of the gradients ranged between
                 17 sec (KCl, valinomycin) to 195 sec (K+-gluconate-).
                 In separate experiments, active Ca2+ uptake was
                 monitored using chlorotetracycline (CTC) fluorescence,
                 a technique validated by 45-Ca2+ measurements (Dixon,
                 D., Brandt, N., Haynes, D.H. 1984. J. Biol. Chem.
                 259:13737-13741). Active Ca2+ uptake was initiated in
                 the presence of monovalent ion gradients. The values of
                 the membrane potentials (Em) imposed by the monovalent
                 ion gradients were calculated using the ion
                 concentrations, their relative permeabilities and the
                 Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. No effect of membrane
                 potential on transport rate was observed (.ltoreq.4\%,
                 for 5-7 SD) for imposed potentials as extreme as
                 .gtoreq.+71 and .ltoreq.-67 mV. Formal analysis shows
                 that the above observations are not compatible with
                 models in which the Ca2+ pumping ATPase functions in an
                 electrogenic or charge-uncompensated fashion. Further
                 experimentation showed that the pump rate is slowed
                 when uptake is measured at less-than-adequate
                 concentrations of buffer (5 vs.25 mM HEPES/ Tris).
                 This, together with further control experiments using
                 nigericin and FCCP, gave evidence that the pump
                 requires a source of counter-transportable H+ in the
                 vesicle lumen. The above experimentation also
                 underlines the need for control of internal pH to
                 obviate erroneous interpretation of ion perturbation
                 experiments. The results are compared with results

                 mediate a diverse array of cell functions, it is not
                 known whether oscillations contribute to the efficiency
                 or specificity of signalling or are merely an
                 inevitable consequence of the feedback control of
                 [Ca2+](i). We have developed a Ca2+ clamp technique to
                 investigate the roles of oscillation amplitude and
                 frequency in regulating gene expression driven by the
                 proinflammatory transcription factors NF-AT, Oct/GAP

                 the effective Ca2+ threshold for activating
                 transcription factors, thereby increasing signal
                 detection at low levels of stimulation. In addition,
                 specificity is encoded by the oscillation frequency:
                 rapid oscillations stimulate all three transcription
                 factors, whereas infrequent oscillations activate only
                 NF-kappa B. The genes encoding the cytokines

                 frequency-sensitive in a way that reflects their degree

                 bovine endothelial cells following treatment with
                 bradykinin (BK). Using laser scanning confocal
                 microscopy, we have found that the Ca2+ indicator,
                 Fluo-3, is compartmentalized in the mitochondria of
                 endothelial cells loaded with Fluo-3/AM. After BK
                 stimulation, the pattern of Ca2+ increase in the
                 cytosol is different from that in the mitochondria. The
                 amplitude of the Ca2+ rise in the mitochondria is
                 higher than that in the cytosol. Further analysis using
                 rapid scanning measurements indicates that the [Ca2+]c
                 increase is very fast after BK addition and reaches a
                 maxima level within 400 ms. In contrast, the [Ca2+]m
                 increase appears to be biphasic with an initial rapid
                 increase (concomitant with the [Ca2+]c increase)
                 followed by a slower [Ca2+]m increase before reaching a
                 maximal level (within 5 s of BK treatment). The
                 differential Ca2+ signaling pattern between the cytosol
                 and the mitochondria suggests that the intracellular

                 was used to monitor mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration
                 ([Ca2+]m) in gastric smooth muscle cells from Bufo
                 marinus. In some studies, fura-2 was used in
                 combination with rhod-2, allowing simultaneous
                 measurement of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i)
                 and [Ca2+]m, respectively. 2. During a short train of
                 depolarizations, which causes Ca2+ influx from the
                 extracellular medium, there was an increase in both
                 [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]m. The half-time (t1/2) to peak for
                 the increase in [Ca2+]m was considerably longer than
                 the t1/2 to peak for the increase in [Ca2+]i. [Ca2+]m
                 remained elevated for tens of seconds after [Ca2+]i had
                 returned to its resting value. 3. Stimulation with
                 caffeine, which causes release of Ca2+ from the
                 sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), also produced increases in
                 both [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]m. The values of t1/2 to peak
                 for the increase in [Ca2+] in both cytoplasm and
                 mitochondria were similar; however, [Ca2+]i returned to
                 baseline values much faster than [Ca2+]m. 4. Using a
                 wide-field digital imaging microscope, changes in
                 [Ca2+]m were monitored within individual mitochondria
                 in situ, during stimulation of Ca2+ influx or Ca2+
                 release from the SR. 5. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake
                 during depolarizing stimulation caused depolarization
                 of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The
                 mitochondrial membrane potential recovered considerably
                 faster than the recovery of [Ca2+]m. 6. This study
                 shows that Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium
                 and Ca2+ release from the SR are capable of increasing
                 [Ca2+]m in smooth muscle cells. The efflux of Ca2+ from
                 the mitochondria is a slow process and appears to be
                 dependent upon the amount of Ca2+ in the SR.",

                 [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) with fura-2. 2. Application of
                 caffeine produced an increase in [Ca2+]i and also
                 increased [Ca2+]m. The increase in [Ca2+]m occurred
                 after the increase in [Ca2+]i, and remained elevated
                 for a considerable time after [Ca2+]i had returned to
                 resting values. 3. The protonophore carbonyl cyanide
                 p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), which
                 causes the mitochondrial membrane potential to
                 collapse, markedly attenuated the increase in [Ca2+]m
                 following caffeine application and also increased the

                 Activation of purinoceptors with ATP also produced
                 increases in both [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]m in these smooth
                 muscle cells. In some cells, oscillations in [Ca2+]i

                 corresponding oscillations in [Ca2+]m and membrane

                 Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, either
                 through ryanodine or inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate

                 accumulate Ca(2+)during physiological
                 [Ca(2+)](c)signalling. This contribution will consider
                 some of the functional consequences of mitochondrial
                 Ca(2+)uptake for cell physiology and pathophysiology.
                 The ability to remove Ca(2+)from local cytosol enables
                 mitochondria to regulate the [Ca(2+)] in microdomains
                 close to IP3-sensitive Ca(2+)-release channels. The
                 [Ca(2+)] sensitivity of these channels means that, by
                 regulating local [Ca(2+)](c), mitochondrial
                 Ca(2+)uptake modulates the rate and extent of
                 propagation of [Ca(2+)](c)waves in a variety of cell
                 types. The coincidence of mitochondrial Ca(2+)uptake
                 with oxidative stress may open the mitochondrial
                 permeability transition pore (mPTP). This is a
                 catastrophic event for the cell that will initiate
                 pathways to cell death either by necrotic or apoptotic
                 pathways. A model is presented in which illumination of
                 an intramitochondrial fluorophore is used to generate
                 oxygen radical species within mitochondria. This causes
                 mitochondrial Ca(2+)loading from SR and triggers mPTP
                 opening. In cardiomyocytes, mPTP opening leads to ATP
                 consumption by the mitochondrial ATPase and so results
                 in ATP depletion, rigor and necrotic cell death. In
                 central mammalian neurons exposed to glutamate, a
                 cellular Ca(2+)overload coincident with NO production
                 also causes loss of mitochondrial potential and cell
                 death, but mPTP involvement has proven more difficult
                 to demonstrate unequivocally. Publishers Ltd.

                 mitochondria has long been established, its functional
                 significance is only now becoming clear in relation to
                 cell physiology and pathophysiology. The observation
                 that mitochondria take up Ca2+ during physiological
                 Ca2+ signalling in a variety of cell types leads to
                 four questions: (i) 'What is the impact of
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on mitochondrial function?'
                 (ii) 'What is the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake
                 on Ca2+ signalling?' (iii) 'What are the consequences
                 of impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake for cell
                 function?' and finally (iv) 'What are the consequences
                 of pathological [Ca2+]c signalling for mitochondrial
                 function?' These will be addressed in turn. Thus: (i)
                 accumulation of Ca2+ into mitochondria regulates
                 mitochondrial metabolism and causes a transient
                 depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane potential.
                 (ii) Mitochondria may act as a spatial Ca2+ buffer in
                 many cells, regulating the local Ca2+ concentration in
                 cellular microdomains. This process regulates processes
                 dependent on local cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration
                 ([Ca2+]c), particularly the flux of Ca2+ through
                 IP3-gated channels of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
                 and the channels mediating capacitative Ca2+ influx
                 through the plasma membrane. Consequently,
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays a substantial role in
                 shaping [Ca2+]c signals in many cell types. (iii)
                 Impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake alters the
                 spatiotemporal characteristics of cellular [Ca2+]c
                 signalling and downregulates mitochondrial metabolism.
                 (iv) Under pathological conditions of cellular [Ca2+]c
                 overload, particularly in association with oxidative
                 stress, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake may trigger
                 pathological states that lead to cell death. In the
                 model of glutamate excitotoxicity, microdomains of
                 [Ca2+]c are apparently central, as the pathway to cell
                 death seems to require the local activation of neuronal
                 nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), itself held by
                 scaffolding proteins in close association with the NMDA
                 receptor. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in combination with
                 NO production triggers the collapse of mitochondrial
                 membrane potential, culminating in delayed cell
                 death.",

                 of mitochondria discretely localized within the cell, a
                 phenomenon that we shall call flicker. These events
                 were usually highly localized and could be restricted
                 to single mitochondria, but they could also be more
                 widely distributed within the cell. Contractile waves,
                 either spontaneous or in response to depolarization
                 with 50 mM K+, were associated with propagating waves
                 of mitochondrial depolarization, suggesting that
                 propagating calcium waves are associated with
                 mitochondrial calcium uptake and consequent
                 depolarization. Here we demonstrate that the
                 mitochondrial flicker was directly related to the focal
                 release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticular (SR)
                 calcium stores and consequent uptake of calcium by
                 local mitochondria. Thus, the events were dramatically
                 reduced by (a) depletion of SR calcium stores after
                 long-term incubation in EGTA or thapsigargin (500 nM);

                 diaminopentane pentammine cobalt (DAPPAC), a novel
                 inhibitor of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter. These
                 observations demonstrate that focal SR calcium release
                 results in calcium microdomains sufficient to promote
                 local mitochondrial calcium uptake, suggesting a tight
                 coupling of calcium signaling between SR release sites

                 changes in spine morphology may mediate synaptic
                 plasticity, the extent of basal spine motility and its
                 regulation and function remains controversial. We
                 investigated spine motility in three principal neurons

                 cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Motility
                 was assayed with time-lapse imaging by using two-photon
                 microscopy of green fluorescent protein-labeled neurons
                 in acute and cultured slices. In all three cell types,
                 dendritic protrusions (filopodia and spines) were
                 highly dynamic, exhibiting a diversity of morphological
                 rearrangements over short (<1-min) time courses. The
                 incidence of spine motility declined during postnatal
                 maturation, but dynamic changes were still apparent in
                 many spines in late-postnatal neurons. Although

                 affect spine motility, disruption of actin
                 polymerization did. We hypothesize that this basal
                 motility of dendritic protrusions is intrinsic to the

                 by numerical simulations different conditions in which
                 spiral Ca2+ waves can occur as a result of the spatial
                 heterogeneity created by the nucleus in a system with
                 geometry resembling that of a myocyte. A region of the
                 cell lacking Ca2+ pools, acting as an obstacle able to
                 break the propagation of planar waves, suffices to
                 initiate a spiral wave; however, this region must be
                 properly placed with respect to the pacemaker. An
                 obstacle behaving as a barrier to diffusion is also
                 able to create the initial bending that can lead to the
                 spiral wave. We study how the occurrence of spiral Ca2+

                 metabolizing enzymes (Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase and
                 5-phosphatase) on the temporal pattern of Ca2+

                 voltage-gated ion channels influence the gating. In
                 previous studies of cloned voltage-gated K channels, we
                 found evidence that the functional surface charges are
                 located on the peptide loop between the fifth
                 transmembrane segment and the pore region (the S5-P
                 loop). In the present study, we determine the role of
                 individual charges of the S5-P loop by correlating
                 primary structure with experimentally calculated
                 surface potentials of the previously investigated
                 channels. The results suggest that contributions to the
                 surface potential at the voltage sensor of the
                 different residues varies in an oscillating pattern,
                 with the first residue of the N-terminal end of the
                 S5-P loop, an absolutely conserved glutamate,
                 contributing most. An analysis yields estimates of the
                 distance between the residues and the voltage sensor,
                 the first N-terminal residue being located at a
                 distance of 5-6 A. To explain the results, a structural
                 hypothesis, comprising an alpha-helical N-terminal end

                 fusionkinetics and lipid phase behavior for several
                 inverted phase forming lipids. N-Methylated
                 dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE-Me), or mixtures
                 of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and
                 dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), will form an
                 inverted hexagonal phase (HII) at high temperatures
                 (above TH), a lamellar phase (L.alpha.) at low
                 temperatures, and an isotropic/inverted cubic phase at
                 intermediate temperatures, which is defined by the
                 appearance of narrow isotropic 31P NMR resonances. The
                 phase behavior has been verified by using
                 high-sensitivity DSC, 31P NMR, freeze-fracture electron
                 microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The temperature
                 range over which the narrow isotropic resonances occur
                 is defined as .DELTA.TI, and the range ends at TH.
                 Extruded liposomes (.apprx.0.2 .mu.m in diameter)
                 composed of these lipids show fusion and leakage
                 kinetics which are strongly correlated with the
                 temperatures of these phase transitions. At
                 temperatures below .DELTA.TI, where the lipid phase is
                 L.alpha., there is little or no fusion, i.e. mixing of
                 aqueous contents, or leakage. However, as the
                 temperature reaches .DELTA.TI, there is a rapid
                 increase in both fusion and leakage rates. At
                 temperature above TH, the liposomes show
                 aggregation-dependent lysis, as the rapid formation of
                 HII phase precursors disrupts the membranes. We show
                 that the correspondence between the fusion and leakage
                 kinetics and the observed phase behavior is easily
                 rationalized in terms of a recent kinetic theory of
                 L.alpha./inverted phase transitions. In particular, it
                 is likely that membrane fusion and the
                 L.alpha./inverted cubic phase transition proceed via a

                 extracellular magnesium ([Mg2+]0). Neomycin together
                 with high external Ca2+, by contrast, induced a
                 reversal in the polarity of turning and branching, with
                 neurites reorienting and branching more frequently
                 anodally. Aminoglycosides decreased neurite growth
                 rates, and for neomycin this was partially reversed by
                 high external Ca2+. Raised [Ca2+]0 alone but not raised
                 [Mg2+]0 altered growth rates in a field-strength
                 dependent manner. Modulation of membrane surface charge
                 may underlie altered galvanotropic orientation and
                 branching. Such an effect is insufficient to explain
                 the changes in growth rates, which may result from
                 additional perturbations to Ca2+ influx and inositol
                 phospholipid metabolism.",

                 polycation concentration alters the direction and
                 extent of field-induced orientation. A decrease in
                 membrane surface charge may underlie these effects. 2.
                 Lyotropic anions increase membrane surface charge and
                 we have examined the effect of perchlorate (ClO4-),
                 thiocyanate (SCN-) and sulphate (SO4(2-)) on galvanic
                 nerve orientation. 3. Perchlorate and SCN- had no
                 effect on field-induced cathodal turning, whereas
                 incubation with SO4(2-) was inhibitory. In addition to
                 its effects on surface charge, SO4(2-) increases
                 production of the second messengers diacylglycerol and
                 inositol trisphosphate. Interestingly, lithium (Li+), a
                 blocker of polyphosphoinositide metabolism, had a
                 similar effect to SO4(2-) on field-induced neurite
                 orientation. 4. We conclude that increasing surface
                 charge with lyotropic anions neither enhances
                 galvanotropic orientation nor underlies the inhibitory
                 effects of SO4(2-) and suggest that modulation of
                 galvanotropism by SO4(2-) occurs owing to changes in
                 the inositolphospholipid second messenger system.",

                 in many cell signaling processes and has been the
                 subject of numerous modeling studies. Only recently has
                 the important role that mitochondria play in the
                 dynamics of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling begun to be
                 considered in experimental work and in computational
                 models. Mitochondria sequester large amounts of Ca(2+)
                 and thus have a modulatory effect on intracellular
                 Ca(2+) signaling, and mitochondrial uptake of Ca(2+),
                 in turn, has a regulatory effect on mitochondrial
                 function. Here we integrate a well-established model of
                 IP3-mediated Ca(2+) signaling with a detailed model of
                 mitochondrial Ca(2+) handling and metabolic function.
                 The incorporation of mitochondria results in
                 oscillations in a bistable formulation of the IP3
                 model, and increasing metabolic substrate decreases the
                 frequency of these oscillations consistent with the
                 literature. Ca(2+) spikes from the cytosol are
                 communicated into mitochondria and are shown to induce
                 realistic metabolic changes. The model has been
                 formulated using a modular approach that is easy to
                 modify and should serve as a useful basis for the
                 investigation of questions regarding the interaction of
                 these two systems. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.",

                 the inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (IP3) receptor
                 (IP3R) in Xenopus oocytes. The number of pulsatile foci
                 is reduced and spiral Ca2+ waves are no longer
                 observed. Rather, target patterns of Ca2+ release
                 predominate, and when fragmented, fail to form spirals.
                 Ca2+ wave velocity, amplitude, decay time, and

                 experimental findings by supplementing an existing
                 mathematical model with a differential equation for
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release. Our calculations

                 role in pattern formation by prolonging the recovery
                 time of IP3Rs from a refractory state. We also show
                 that under conditions of high energization of
                 mitochondria, the Ca2+ dynamics can become bistable

                 signaling and are obligate participants in the active
                 cell death cascade known as apoptosis. Underlying these
                 functions is the cyclosporin A (CSA)-sensitive
                 mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP), which
                 can open transiently in a low conductance mode (MTPL)
                 to relieve excess Ca2+, and irreversibly during the
                 initiation of apoptosis. Here we image for the first
                 time CSA- and Ca2+-sensitive cyclical mitochondrial
                 depolarizations in cultures of the SH-SY5Y human

                 channel activity. Moreover, networks of mitochondria
                 are shown to behave as an excitable system that may use
                 Ca2+ as a diffusible messenger to recruit neighboring
                 mitochondria to depolarize. We propose that these
                 depolarizations represent MTPL activity. Our data

                 microscope, based on a Nikon RCM 8000, incorporates a
                 femtosecond pulsed laser with wavelength tunable from
                 690 to 1050 nm, prechirper optics for laser pulse-width
                 compression, resonant galvanometer for video-rate point
                 scanning, and a pair of nonconfocal detectors for fast
                 emission ratioing. An increase in fluorescent emission
                 of 1.75-fold is consistently obtained with the use of
                 the prechirper optics. The nonconfocal detectors
                 provide another 2.25-fold increase in detection
                 efficiency. Ratio imaging and optical sectioning can
                 therefore be performed more efficiently without
                 confocal optics. Faster frame rates, at 60, 120, and

                 myocytes at room temperature using the fluorescent Ca2+
                 indicators fluo-3 and Oregon Green 488 Bapta 5N. 2.
                 Depolarizations to positive potentials elicited fluo-3
                 Ca2+ transients with rates of rise that were linearly
                 related to the magnitude of the peak measured Ca2+
                 current in the presence of Cs+-containing pipette
                 solutions. 3. Further experiments utilizing prepulses
                 to preactivate a constant number of channels also
                 revealed a linear relationship between the Ca2+
                 transient rate of rise and the magnitude of entering
                 Ca2+ current at positive potentials. Under these
                 conditions as well, the maximal rates of rise of global
                 myoplasmic Ca2+ transients were due primarily to Ca2+
                 release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum as revealed by
                 effects of ryanodine and caffeine on the Ca2+
                 transients. Using such prepulses, linearity between the
                 Ca2+ transient rate of rise and the magnitude of the
                 peak Ca2+ current was found under a variety of pulse
                 protocols. 4. Using one such pulse protocol, linearity
                 between the Ca2+ transient rate of rise and the
                 magnitude of the peak Ca2+ current was also found when
                 Ca2+ currents assessed at one potential were reduced in
                 magnitude during the onset of block by application of
                 Co2+. Using the same pulse protocol, linearity between
                 the Ca2+ transient rate of rise and the magnitude of
                 the peak Ca2+ current was also found when use of Cs+
                 was avoided by blocking K+ currents with extracellular
                 TEA and 4-aminopyridine. Linearity in the relationship
                 between the Ca2+ transient rate of rise and the
                 magnitude of the peak Ca2+ current was also found when
                 Ca2+ transients were measured using the low affinity
                 Ca2+ indicator Oregon Green 488 Bapta 5N in place of
                 fluo-3. 5. These results appear to indicate that the
                 cardiac ryanodine receptor is capable of being
                 activated by only one calcium ion. Alternative
                 interpretations of the data are discussed.",

  abstract =     "The role of Ca2+ in chemotaxis of eosinophils from the
                 newt Taricha granulosa was investigated using
                 fluorescent indicators and digital imaging microscopy.
                 In response to serum chemoattractant, cytoplasmic Ca2+
                 concentration ([Ca2+]i) rises prior to polarization. In
                 polarized locomoting cells [Ca2+]i gradients
                 (tail-high-front-low) are always seen, and when cells
                 turn [Ca2+]i rises transiently and falls fastest and
                 furthest in the new direction of cell motion. These
                 Ca2+ signals, which are required for polarization and
                 locomotion, arise from Ca2+ derived from internal
                 stores released in response to inositol
                 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) (because microinjected
                 heparin fully blocks them). 1,2-Diacyl-sn-glycerol
                 (DAG), which is co-produced with InsP3, has an
                 inhibitory effect on Ca2+ signals, an effect apparently
                 mediated by protein kinase C. Studies with caged InsP3
                 reveal that InsP3-responsive stores appear to be
                 concentrated in the nuclear and microtubule-organizing
                 centre regions and that InsP3 moves so rapidly within
                 the cell that it is effectively a global secondary
                 messenger. Thus, stable [Ca2+] gradients observed
                 during unidirectional migration appear to result from
                 the concentration of InsP3-responsive Ca2+ stores in
                 the rear of the cell. By contrast, we propose that
                 reorientation of the [Ca2+] gradient prior to a change
                 in direction of motion results from the joint actions
                 of InsP3 and DAG, with InsP3 acting as a global
                 secondary messenger stimulating Ca2+ release and DAG,
                 through protein kinase C, acting as a spatially
                 restricted secondary messenger inhibiting [Ca2+]
                 increases locally near the site of chemotactic
                 stimulation. [References: 34]",

                 presynaptic sites is a hallmark of mature synapses.
                 However, the spatial distribution patterns of Ca2+
                 channels at newly formed synapses have not yet been
                 demonstrated. Similarly, it is unclear whether Ca2+
                 'hotspots' often observed at the presynaptic sites are
                 indeed target cell contact specific and represent a
                 specialized mechanism by which Ca2+ channels are
                 targeted to select synaptic sites. Utilizing both
                 soma-soma paired (synapsed) and single neurons from the
                 mollusk Lymnaea, we have tested the hypothesis that
                 differential gradients of voltage-dependent Ca2+
                 signals develop in presynaptic neuron at its contact
                 point with the postsynaptic neuron; and that these Ca2+
                 hotspots are target cell contact specific. Fura-2
                 imaging, or two-photon laser scanning microscopy of
                 Calcium Green, was coupled with electrophysiological
                 techniques to demonstrate that voltage-induced Ca2+
                 gradients (hotspots) develop in the presynaptic cell at
                 its contact point with the postsynaptic neuron, but not
                 in unpaired single cells. The incidence of Ca2+
                 hotspots coincided with the appearance of synaptic
                 transmission between the paired cells, and these
                 gradients were target cell contact specific. In
                 contrast, the voltage-induced Ca2+ signal in unpaired
                 neurons was uniformly distributed throughout the
                 somata; a similar pattern of Ca2+ gradient was observed
                 in the presynaptic neuron when it was soma-soma paired
                 with a non-synaptic partner cell. Moreover, voltage
                 clamp recording techniques, in conjunction with a fast,
                 optical differential perfusion system, were used to
                 demonstrate that the total whole-cell Ca2+ (or Ba2+)
                 current density in single and paired cells was not
                 significantly different. However, the amplitude of Ba2+
                 current was significantly higher in the presynaptic
                 cell at its contact side with the postsynaptic neurons,
                 compared with non-contacted regions. In summary, this
                 study demonstrates that voltage-induced Ca2+ hotspots
                 develop in the presynaptic cell, concomitant with the
                 appearance of synaptic transmission between the
                 soma-soma paired cells. The appearance of Ca2+
                 gradients in presynaptic neurons is target cell contact
                 specific and is probably due to a spatial
                 redistribution of existing channels during
                 synaptogenesis.",

  abstract =     "Mitochondria in the heart play two roles essential for
                 cell survival: ATP synthesis and maintenance of Ca2+
                 homeostasis. These two processes are driven by the same
                 energy source, the H+ electrochemical gradient (delta
                 microH). Under aerobic physiologic conditions,
                 mitochondria do not contribute to the beat-to-beat
                 regulation of cytosolic Ca2+, although a Ca2+ transient
                 in mitochondrial matrix has been described. Micromolar
                 increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration stimulate
                 the Krebs cycle and the NADH redox potential and,
                 therefore, ATP synthesis. Trimetazidine has been shown
                 to improve the calcium transient and, in so doing, the
                 overall myocardial energy production. Under pathologic
                 conditions, mitochondrial Ca2+ overload causes a series
                 of vicious cycles that lead to irreversible cell
                 damage. During ischemia, an alteration in intracellular
                 Ca2+ homeostasis occurs and mitochondria are able to
                 buffer cytosolic Ca2+, suggesting that they retain the
                 Ca(2+)-transporting capacity. Accordingly, once
                 isolated, even after prolonged ischemia the majority of
                 the mitochondria are able to use oxygen for ATP
                 phosphorylation. When isolated after reperfusion,
                 mitochondria are structurally altered, contain large
                 quantities of Ca2+, and produce an excess of oxygen
                 free radicals. Their membrane pores are stimulated and
                 the capacity for oxidative phosphorylation is
                 irreversibly disrupted. The role of mitochondrial DNA
                 damage in progressive human diseases such as coronary
                 atherosclerosis is receiving growing interest. The
                 sequence of ischemia and reperfusion, through increased
                 production of oxygen free radicals, causes
                 mitochondrial deletions in several areas of the
                 mitochondrial genome. This cumulative mitochondrial DNA
                 damage is associated with induction of nuclear
                 oxidative phosphorylation gene mRNA. These observations
                 support the hypothesis that mitochondria and
                 mitochondrial DNA damage play important roles in
                 ischemic heart disease. [References: 80]",

                 switch-like one. For example, if two or more signaling

                 depolarization-evoked intracellular calcium changes
                 (delta [Ca2+]i) was estimated by titrating the
                 endogenous buffer against incremental concentrations of
                 the Ca(2+)-sensitive dye fura-2. 2. In cells from
                 15-day-old rats, pulse-evoked delta [Ca2+]i were stable
                 during the loading with 0.5 mM fura-2 through the patch
                 pipette. In cells from 6-day-old rats, delta [Ca2+]i
                 decreased by approximately 50\% during equivalent
                 experiments. This decrease was not related to changes
                 in Ca2+ influx, since the integral of the Ca2+ currents
                 remained constant throughout the recording. 3.
                 Experiments with high fura-2 concentrations (1.75-3.5
                 mM) were performed in order to obtain for each cell the
                 curve relating delta [Ca2+]i to fura-2 concentration.
                 From this relationship, values for the Ca2+ binding
                 ratio (the ratio of buffer-bound Ca2+ changes over free
                 Ca2+ changes) were calculated. 4. In Purkinje cells
                 from 15-day-old rats, the Ca2+ binding ratio was
                 approximately 2000, an order of magnitude larger than
                 that of other neurones and neuroendocrine cells studied
                 to date. This Ca2+ binding ratio was significantly
                 smaller (approximately 900) in Purkinje cells from
                 6-day-old rats. 5. We propose that the large Ca2+
                 binding ratio of Purkinje cells is related to the
                 presence of large concentrations of Ca2+ binding
                 proteins and that these cells regulate their ability to
                 handle Ca2+ loads during development through changes in
                 the concentration of Ca2+ binding proteins.",

                 following depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i rises were
                 investigated in Purkinje cell somata using tight-seal
                 whole-cell recordings and fura-2 microfluorometry, for
                 peak [Ca2+]i ranging from 50 nm to 2 microM. 2. Cai2+
                 decay was well fitted by a double exponential with time
                 constants of O.6 and 3 s. Both time constants were
                 independent of peak [Ca2+]i but the contribution of the
                 faster component increased with [Ca2+]i. 3.
                 Thapsigargin (10 microM) and cyclopiazonic acid (50
                 microM) prolonged Cai2+ decay indicating that
                 sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ (SERCA) pumps
                 contribute to Purkinje cell Cai2+ clearance. 4. A
                 modest participation in clearance was found for the
                 plasma membrane Ca2+ (PMCA) pumps using
                 5,6-succinimidyl carboxyeosin (40 microM). 5. The
                 Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger also contributed to the clearance
                 process, since replacement of extracellular Na+ by Li+
                 slowed Cai2+ decay. 6. Carbonyl cyanide
                 m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, 2 microM) and rotenone
                 (10 microM) increased [Ca2+]i and elicited large inward
                 currents at -60 mV. Both effects were also obtained
                 with CCCP in the absence of external Ca2+, suggesting
                 that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake uncouplers release Ca2+
                 from intracellular stores and may alter the membrane
                 permeability to Ca2+. These effects were irreversible
                 and impeded tests on the role of mitochondria in Cai2+
                 clearance. 7. The relative contribution of the
                 clearance systems characterized in this study varied as
                 a function of [Ca2+]i. At 0.5 microM Cai2+, SERCA pumps
                 and the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger contribute equally to
                 removal and account for 78\% of the process. Only 45\%
                 of the removal at 2 microM Cai2+ can be explained by
                 these systems. In this high [Ca2+]i range the major
                 contribution is that of SERCA pumps (21\%) and of the
                 Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger (18\%), whereas the contribution
                 of PMCA pumps is only 6\%.",

                 in regulating the free myoplasmic Ca2+ level for the
                 contractile activation of skeletal muscle. The initial
                 stages of the voltage-controlled Ca2+ release mechanism
                 are known in molecular detail. However, there is still
                 very little known about the later stages of Ca2+ uptake
                 and total Ca2+ turnover in the contraction-relaxation
                 cycle under normal physiological conditions or under
                 conditions influenced by fatigue or disease. Ca2+
                 uptake and release are both accompanied by counter-ion'
                 movements across the SR membrane which prevent or
                 reduce the generation of SR membrane potentials and
                 balance for electroneutrality in the SR lumen. The SR
                 membrane is permeable for the cations K+, Na+, H+ and
                 Mg2+ and the anion Cl-. Using electron-probe X-ray
                 microanalysis. It has been shown that during tetanic
                 stimulation the Ca2+ release was mainly balanced by
                 uptake of K+ and Mg2+ leaving a charge deficit that was
                 assumed to be neutralized via H+ ion or organic
                 counter-ion movement. The low time resolution of
                 electron-probe X-ray microanalysis leaves the
                 possibility of other transient concentration changes in
                 the SR, e.g. for Cl- ions. Possible physiological roles
                 of the SR counter-ion conductances can be tested using
                 skinned muscle fibre preparations with intact
                 sarcoplasmic reticulum and removed or chemically
                 permeabilized outer sarcolemma. In skinned fibres, the
                 SR K+ conductance can be effectively reduced with SR K+
                 channel blockers such as 4-aminopyridine,
                 tetraethylammonium and decamethonium. Interestingly,
                 these blockers increase Ca2+ loading as well as Ca2+
                 release, whereas other less specific blockers, such as
                 1.10-bis-quanidino-n-decane, seem to reduce Ca2+
                 release, possibly also via blocking Ca2+ release
                 channels. Thus, it seems very important also to test
                 the effects of counter-currents carried by K+, Mg2+, H+
                 or Cl- ions on intact and voltage-clamped single-fibre
                 preparations.",

                 (InsP3) releases Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores by
                 activating specific receptors on the membranes of these
                 stores. In many cells, InsP3 is a global signalling
                 molecule that liberates Ca2+ throughout the cytoplasm.
                 However, in neurons the situation might be different,
                 because synaptic activity may produce InsP3 at discrete
                 locations. Here we characterize InsP3 signalling in
                 postsynaptic cerebellar Purkinje neurons, which have a
                 high level of InsP3 receptors. We find that repetitive
                 activation of the synapse between parallel fibres and
                 Purkinje cells causes InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release in
                 the Purkinje cells. This Ca2+ release is restricted to
                 individual postsynaptic spines, where both metabotropic
                 glutamate receptors and InsP3 receptors are located, or
                 to multiple spines and adjacent dendritic shafts. Focal
                 photolysis of caged InsP3 in Purkinje cell dendrites
                 also produces Ca2+ signals that spread only a few
                 micrometres from the site of InsP3 production. Uncaged
                 InsP3 produces a long-lasting depression of
                 parallel-fibre synaptic transmission that is limited to
                 synapses where the Ca2+ concentration is raised. Thus,
                 in Purkinje cells InP3 acts within a restricted spatial
                 range that allows it to regulate the function of local
                 groups of parallel-fibre synapses.",

                 He/sup 2+/ and Ne/sup 2+/ show enhancements over
                 sequential tunneling. For circularly polarized pulses
                 the data show no distinct enhancements. Dynamic
                 resonances, which produce similar enhancements in the

                 considered: a shake-off model, and a semiclassical

                 science have involved measuring the spectrum and
                 autocorrelation of the input pulse(s) and only
                 measuring the integrated energy or perhaps
                 time-resolved energy of the output signal. These
                 experiments ignored the information contained in the
                 input and output pulse phases and intensity profiles.
                 New pulse measurement techniques such as
                 frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG), when combined
                 with older techniques such as spectral interferometry,
                 now allow the complete characterization of the pulses.
                 These techniques allow measurements of the intensity,
                 phase, and polarization state of ultrashort pulses as
                 functions of time (or frequency) and space. These
                 techniques work for wavelengths from the UV to the IR
                 and for extremely weak pulses and very high power
                 pulses. They also allow entirely new classes of
                 experiments for measuring ultrafast phenomena. Now the
                 phases and temporal profiles of the input pulses may be
                 measured and controlled, and the intensity and phase of
                 the output pulses can also be measured. These new
                 measurement techniques have thus greatly increased the
                 obtainable information in ultrafast experiments. This
                 paper reviews current pulse measurement methods
                 including frequency-resolved optical gating and
                 spectral interferometry and describes how they are

  abstract =     "A basic assumption underlies many designs for
                 chirped-pulse amplification of ultrashort pulses. This
                 assumption is that a TaylorÕs series expansion of the
                 dispersive delay is well behaved in the sense that each
                 phase order in the expansion produces an effect on the
                 pulse that is significantly smaller than the effect of
                 the previous order. This work investigates this
                 assumption both qualitatively and quantitatively. We
                 show quantitatively that the requirements for achieving
                 sub-20 fs pulses are much more stringent than for 100
                 fs pulses. We find that when the basic assumption
                 holds, a CPA system may be designed by zeroing each
                 order in succession, but that zeroing may not work well
                 for some systems that are not well behaved. For these
                 cases minimizing the overall dispersion becomes
                 necessary. We discuss some common optical components
                 including bulk materials, expanders, and compressors
                 and show that they generally satisfy the basic
                 assumption. We also discuss some optical components or
                 effects that may not satisfy the basic assumption such
                 as dielectric mirrors or etalons, and describe means of
                 limiting the problems associated with them when
                 designing ultrafast CPA systems. Finally, we discuss
                 the problem of optimizing a CPA system in the
                 laboratory, and describe a new polarization-gate
                 frequency-resolved optical gating arrangement that is
                 based on thin-film polarizers and that allows accurate
                 measurements of the phase as well as the intensity with

                 for such objectives, it is not clear theoretically that
                 such a measurement should work. Such objectives can
                 produce severe distortions of the pulse as a function
                 of radius in the objective. In addition, the standard
                 SHG FROG algorithms are based on the assumption that
                 the fundamental and second harmonic fields are plane
                 waves that can be described by the paraxial
                 approximation, and for high NA objectives, such

                 fields (EMF) was studied in 250 leukemia patients and
                 261 brain-tumor cases, diagnosed in 1983-87 and
                 compared with a control group of 1,121 randomly
                 selected men, from the mid-region of Sweden, 1983-87.
                 We based the exposure assessment on measurements from
                 1,015 different workplaces. On the basis of the job
                 held longest during the 10-year period before
                 diagnosis, we found an association between the average,
                 daily, mean level of EMF and chronic lymphocytic
                 leukemia (CLL). The risk increased with increasing
                 level of exposure. The odds ratios (OR) and the 95
                 percent confidence interval (CI) for three consecutive
                 levels of exposure were: 1.1 (CI = 0.5-2.3); 2.2 (CI =
                 1.1-4.3); 3.0 (CI = 1.6-5.8), respectively. No
                 association was observed for acute myeloid leukemia (OR
                 = 1.0, CI = 0.5-1.8; OR = 0.8, CI = 0.4-1.6; OR = 1.0,
                 CI = 0.6-1.9). For brain tumors, the corresponding risk
                 estimates were 1.0 (CI = 0.7-1.6); 1.5 (CI = 1.0-2.2);
                 1.4 (CI = 0.9-2.1). Different EMF indices were tested.
                 Tasks with frequent or large variations between high
                 and low field-densities (high standard deviation) were
                 more common among CLL subjects. For brain tumors, a
                 prolonged high level (high median values) showed the
                 strongest association. Confounding by place of
                 residence, smoking, benzene, ionizing radiation,
                 pesticides, and solvents was evaluated, and these
                 factors did not seem to have a decisive influence on
                 the associations. We also analyzed other potential
                 sources of bias. For CLL, there were indications of an
                 excess number of low-exposure subjects among
                 non-responders, which, to some extent, may have
                 enhanced but not caused the risk estimates obtained.
                 Our conclusion is that the study supports the
                 hypothesis that occupational EMF exposure is a hazard

                 striated muscle, depolarization of the surface membrane
                 is converted into Ca2+ release from internal stores.
                 This process occurs at intracellular junctions
                 characterized by a specialized composition and
                 structural organization of membrane proteins. The
                 coordinated arrangement of the two key junctional
                 components--the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) in the
                 surface membrane and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) in
                 the sarcoplasmic reticulum--is essential for their
                 normal, tissue-specific function in e-c coupling. The
                 mechanisms involved in the formation of the junctions
                 and a potential participation of DHPRs and RyRs in this
                 process have been subject of intensive studies over the
                 past 5 years. In this review we discuss recent advances
                 in understanding the organization of these molecules in
                 skeletal and cardiac muscle, as well as their
                 concurrent and independent assembly during development
                 of normal and mutant muscle. From this information we
                 derive a model for the assembly of the junctions and
                 the establishment of the precise structural
                 relationship between DHPRs and RyRs that underlies
                 their interaction in e-c coupling.",

                 4-benzoquinone, and
                 2,3-dimethoxy-5,6-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone) were
                 ineffective. Pore inhibition was observed irrespective
                 of the method used to induce the permeability
                 transition (addition of Pi or atractylate, membrane
                 depolarization, or dithiol cross-linking). Inhibition
                 of PTP opening by decylubiquinone was comparable with
                 that exerted by cyclosporin A, whereas ubiquinone 0 was
                 more potent. Ubiquinone 5, which did not inhibit the
                 PTP per se, specifically counteracted the inhibitory
                 effect of ubiquinone 0 or decylubiquinone but not that
                 of cyclosporin A. These findings define a
                 ubiquinone-binding site directly involved in PTP
                 regulation and indicate that different quinone
                 structural features are required for binding and for
                 stabilizing the pore in the closed conformation. At
                 variance from all other quinones tested,
                 decylubiquinone did not inhibit respiration. Our
                 results define a new structural class of pore
                 inhibitors and may open new perspectives for the
                 pharmacological modulation of the PTP in vivo.",

                 laevis after fertilization. Eggs were placed in agar
                 wells with their animal poles downward so that
                 fertilization occurred preferentially in the equatorial
                 plane, and confocal microscopy was used to provide a
                 two-dimensional optical section through the
                 three-dimensional Ca2+ wave. These data indicate that
                 the wave of increased [Ca2+]i traverses the entire egg
                 and converges uniformly on the antipode. We show that
                 ratioing two different fluorescent dyes to correct for
                 variations in cell thickness is not a reliable
                 technique for this very thick cell due to differential
                 absorption with depth. Indo-1-dextran proves to be a
                 more reliable Ca2+ indicator in this respect.
                 Indo-1-dextran measurements indicate that the resting
                 [Ca2+]i is not uniform throughout the egg but exhibits
                 a 15\% higher [Ca2+]i in the cortex than deep in the
                 cytoplasm. This difference is accentuated during wave
                 propagation and is not dependent on extracellular Ca2+.
                 The average peak [Ca2+]i in the center of the egg as
                 the wave propagates through it is 0.7 mgr;M,
                 approximately 60\% of the peak cortical [Ca2+]i. The
                 wave velocity through the center of the egg (5.7
                 mgr;m/s) is slower than that in the cortex (8.9
                 mgr;m/s), and both velocities vary slightly during
                 transit. The cortical wave speed is particularly high
                 at the beginning (15.7 mgr;m/s) and end (17.2
                 mgr;m/s) of the wave. Eggs injected with 30-80 &mgr;M
                 of 3 kD heparin to compete with
                 inositol-1,4,5,-trisphosphate for binding to its
                 receptor exhibited multiple localized spots of elevated
                 [Ca2+]i, and many of these did not initiate a wave. For
                 those that did lead to a wave, it was usually slow
                 moving and exhibited a reduced (60\% reduction)
                 amplitude compared with controls.",

  abstract =     "The ryanodine receptor (RyR) is a high-conductance
                 Ca2+ channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle
                 and of the endoplasmic reticulum in other cells. In
                 striated muscle fibers, RyRs are responsible for the
                 rapid release of Ca2+ that activates contraction.
                 Ryanodine receptors are complex molecules, with
                 unusually large cytoplasmic domains containing numerous
                 binding sites for agents that control the state of
                 activity of the channel-forming domain of the molecule.
                 Structural considerations indicate that long-range
                 interactions between cytoplasmic and intramembrane
                 domains control channel function. Ryanodine receptors
                 are located in specialized regions of the SR, where
                 they are structurally and functionally associated with
                 other intrinsic proteins and, indirectly, also with the
                 luminal Ca2(+)-binding protein calsequestrin.
                 Activation of RyRs during the early part of the
                 excitation-contraction coupling cascade is initiated by
                 the activity of surface-membrane Ca2+ channels, the
                 dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs). Skeletal and cardiac
                 muscles contain different RyR and DHPR isoforms and
                 both contribute to the diversity in cardiac and
                 skeletal excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms.
                 The architecture of the sarcoplasmic reticulum-surface
                 junctions determines the types of RyR-DHPR interactions
                 in the two muscle types.",

                 reticulum (SR) and of exterior membranes (either
                 surface membrane or transverse (T) tubules). This
                 interaction occurs at special structures named calcium
                 release units (CRUs). CRUs contain two proteins
                 essential to e-c coupling: dihydropyridine receptors
                 (DHPRs), L-type Ca(2+) channels of exterior membranes;
                 and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), the Ca(2+) release
                 channels of the SR. Special CRUs in cardiac muscle are
                 constituted by SR domains bearing RyRs that are not
                 associated with exterior membranes (the corbular and
                 extended junctional SR or EjSR). Functional groupings
                 of RyRs and DHPRs within calcium release units have
                 been named couplons, and the term is also loosely
                 applied to the EjSR of cardiac muscle. Knowledge of the
                 structure, geometry, and disposition of couplons is
                 essential to understand the mechanism of Ca(2+) release
                 during muscle activation. This paper presents a
                 compilation of quantitative data on couplons in a
                 variety of skeletal and cardiac muscles, which is
                 useful in modeling calcium release events, both

                 enigma for over two decades. We present new data on
                 optical second harmonic generation in native, wet,
                 rat-tail tendon. Scanning second-harmonic microscopy
                 has revealed, for the first time, the existence of a
                 discrete network of fine, polar, filamentous or
                 columnar, structures, and, also, the presence of
                 strongly polar surface, or near-surface patches. The
                 thickness of these features was probed via crossed-beam
                 optical frequency summation and the polar material is
                 estimated to occupy a few percent of the tendon volume.
                 The three-dimensional spatial distribution of filaments
                 was studied with the aid of small-angle second-harmonic
                 scattering, and the filaments were found to permeate
                 the tendon cross-section in an apparently random
                 fashion. These latter measurements also revealed that
                 essentially all polar filaments had the same
                 directionality. Concomitant studies of the polar
                 collagen fibrils that comprise the bulk of tendon were
                 in full accord with prior electron microscope results
                 that had demonstrated that the directionality of these
                 fibrils varies up/down in a purely random fashion, and
                 thus cannot yield a net macroscopic polarity.
                 Quantitative analysis of the second-harmonic data
                 yields the conclusion that the observed polar
                 structures cannot be simply local regions containing
                 some accidental net excess of similarly oriented
                 fibrils. The analytical expressions used in the
                 analysis of the data obtained for this complex tissue
                 were supported by extensive, realistic computer
                 simulations. The discovery that the polarity of
                 rat-tail tendon, and possibly other forms of connective
                 tissue, resides in discrete structures, some of which
                 are located near the tendon surface, should permit the
                 ready isolation of polar-rich material for further
                 study by a variety of techniques.",

                 intracellular Ca(2+)levels during and after
                 physiological stimulation. While extensive information
                 is available regarding the structural and biophysical
                 properties of Ca(2+)channels, pumps and exchangers that
                 control cellular Ca(2+)movements, little is known about
                 the quantitative properties of the transporters that
                 are expressed together in intact cells or about the way
                 they operate as a system to orchestrate
                 stimulus-induced Ca(2+)signals. This lack of
                 information is particularly striking given that many
                 qualitative properties of Ca(2+)signals (e.g. whether
                 the Ca(2+)concentration within a particular organelle
                 rises or falls during stimulation) depend critically on
                 quantitative properties of the underlying
                 Ca(2+)transporters (e.g. the rates of Ca(2+)uptake and
                 release by the organelle). This monograph describes the
                 in situ characterization of Ca(2+)transport pathways in
                 sympathetic neurons, showing how mitochondrial
                 Ca(2+)uptake and release systems define the direction
                 and rate of net Ca(2+)transport by this organelle, and

                 This model is coupled to equations describing Ca2+,
                 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), ATP, and Na+
                 homeostasis, including the uptake and release of Ca2+
                 by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In our model,
                 metabolically derived ATP activates inward Ca2+ flux by
                 regulation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and
                 depolarization of the plasma membrane. Results from the
                 simulations support the hypothesis that intracellular
                 Na+ and Ca2+ in the ER can be the main variables
                 driving both fast (2-7 osc/min) and slow intracellular
                 Ca2+ concentration oscillations (0.3-0.9 osc/min) and
                 that the effect of IP3 on Ca2+ leak from the ER
                 contributes to the pattern of slow calcium
                 oscillations. Simulations also show that filling the ER
                 Ca2+ stores leads to faster electrical bursting and
                 Ca2+ oscillations. Specific Ca2+ oscillations in

                 the photolysis could be powered by pairs of IR photons
                 rather than the customary single UV photons. The
                 quadratic dependence on light intensity would confine

                 Neurophysiol. 88: 2430-2444, 2002. Computational
                 capabilities of Purkinje cells (PCs) are central to the
                 cerebellum function. Information originating from the
                 whole nervous system converges on their dendrites, and
                 their axon is the sole output of the cerebellar cortex.
                 PC dendrites respond to weak synaptic activation with
                 long-lasting, low-amplitude plateau potentials, but
                 stronger synaptic activation can generate fast, large
                 amplitude calcium spikes. Pharmacological data have
                 suggested the involvement of only the P-type of Ca
                 channels in both of these electric responses. However,
                 the mechanism allowing this Ca current to underlie
                 responses with such different dynamics is still
                 unclear. This mechanism was explored by constraining a
                 biophysical model with electrophysiological,
                 Ca-imaging, and single ion channel data. A model is
                 presented here incorporating a simplified description
                 of [Ca]i regulation and three ionic currents: 1) the
                 P-type Ca current, 2) a delayed-rectifier K current,
                 and 3) a generic class of K channels activating sharply
                 in the sub-threshold voltage range. This model sustains
                 fast spikes and long-lasting plateaus terminating
                 spontaneously with recovery of the resting potential.
                 Small depolarizing, tonic inputs turn plateaus into a
                 stable membrane state and endow the dendrite with
                 bistability properties. With larger tonic inputs, the
                 plateau remains the unique equilibrium state, showing
                 long traces of transient inhibitory inputs that are
                 called valley potentials because their dynamics mirrors
                 that of inverted, finite-duration plateaus. Analyzing
                 the slow subsystem obtained by assuming instantaneous
                 activation of the delayed-rectifier reveals that the
                 time course of plateaus and valleys is controlled by
                 the slow [Ca]i dynamics, which arises from the high
                 Ca-buffering capacity of PCs. A bifurcation analysis
                 shows that tonic currents modulate sub-threshold
                 dynamics by displacing the resting state along a
                 hysteresis region edged by two saddle-node
                 bifurcations; these bifurcations mark transitions from
                 finite-duration plateaus to bistability and from
                 bistability to valley potentials, respectively. This
                 low-dimensionality model may be introduced into
                 large-scale models to explore the role of PC dendrite
                 computations in the functional capabilities of the
                 cerebellum.",

                 presence of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in mitochondria
                 (mtNOS) was recently reported by us (Ghafourifar and
                 Richter, FEBS Lett. 418, 291-296, 1997) and others
                 (Giulivi et al., J. Biol. Chem. 273, 11038-11043,
                 1998). Here we report that NO, provided by an NO donor
                 as well as by mtNOS stimulation, regulates
                 mitochondrial matrix pH, transmembrane potential and
                 Ca2+ buffering capacity. Exogenously-added NO causes a
                 dose-dependent matrix acidification. Also mtNOS
                 stimulation, induced by loading mitochondria with Ca2+,
                 causes mitochondrial matrix acidification and a drop in
                 mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Inhibition of
                 mtNOS's basal activity causes mitochondrial matrix
                 alkalinization and provides a resistance to the sudden
                 drop of mitochondrial transmembrane potential induced
                 by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. We conclude that mtNOS
                 plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial

                 neuroendocrine cells is a plausible explanation for the
                 slowness and latency in the secretion of hormones. We
                 have developed a Monte Carlo simulation to treat the
                 problem of 3-D diffusion and kinetic reactions of ions
                 and buffers. The 3-D diffusion is modeled as a random
                 walk process that follows the path of each ion and
                 buffer molecule, combined locally with a stochastic
                 treatment of the first-order kinetic reactions
                 involved. Such modeling is able to predict [Ca(2+)] and
                 buffer concentration time courses regardless of how low
                 the calcium influx is, and it is therefore a convenient
                 method for dealing with physiological calcium currents
                 and concentrations. We study the effects of the
                 diffusional and kinetic parameters of the model on the
                 concentration time courses as well as on the local
                 equilibrium of buffers with calcium. An in-mobile and
                 fast endogenous buffer as described by, Biophys. J.
                 72:674-690) was able to reach local equilibrium with
                 calcium; however, the exogenous buffers considered are
                 displaced drastically from equilibrium at the start of
                 the calcium pulse, particularly below the pores. The
                 versatility of the method also allows the effect of
                 different arrangements of calcium channels on
                 submembrane gradients to be studied, including random
                 distribution of calcium channels and channel clusters.
                 The simulation shows how the particular distribution of
                 channels or clusters can be of relevance for secretion
                 in the case where the distribution of release granules
                 is correlated with the channels or clusters.",

                 cycling, emphasizing the kinetics of sarcoplasmic
                 reticulum (SR) Ca++ release channels. The suggested SR
                 channel regulating mechanism includes two types of Ca++
                 binding sites: (1) low affinity sites with high binding
                 rates, regulating the opening of Ca++ channels and (2)
                 high affinity sites with low binding rates, which
                 regulate their closing. The amount of Ca++ released
                 from the SR and the peak value of Ca++ ion
                 concentration [Ca++] in the cytoplasm were found to
                 depend on the rate of the increase of [Ca++], similar
                 to Ca++ induced Ca++ release experiments. The model
                 describes spontaneous release of Ca++ from overloaded
                 SR. The dependence of the control mechanism on the
                 activating and inactivating sites is substantiated by
                 simulations of ryanodine intervention, providing
                 results similar to experimental results. Simulations
                 under conditions of isolated SR vesicles produced Ca++
                 release results similar to measured data. Consequently,
                 it is suggested that the recovery of Ca++ release
                 channels represents the rate limiting factor in the
                 process of mechanical restitution.",

                 vinculin-deficient (5.51) mouse embryonal carcinoma
                 cells. F9 cells extended filopodia at a rate of 61 (
                 +/- 18) nm/s over a distance of 3.18 (+/- 0.29)
                 microns. In contrast, 5.51 cells exhibited filopodia
                 which extended at a similar speed of 57 (+/- 17) nm/s
                 but over a longer distance of 5.10 (+/- 2.14) microns.
                 Cell-substratum contact areas of both cell types were
                 examined by reflection interference contrast
                 microscopy. Wild-type F9 cells had distinct close
                 contacts (dark gray areas) at the cell periphery,
                 whereas 5.51 cells had only a few light gray pinpoint
                 contacts with the substrate. Confocal microscopy showed
                 alpha-actinin to be localized along actin stress fibers
                 in wild-type cells, and in 5.51 cells stress fibers
                 were absent and alpha-actinin was associated with
                 F-actin in the filopodia. beta 1-integrin, talin, and
                 paxillin were concentrated in focal contacts in
                 wild-type cells, but in 5.51 cells beta 1-integrin and
                 talin were in patches under the plasma membrane and
                 paxillin was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. We
                 conclude that changes in cell shape and motility of
                 5.51 compared to wild-type F9 cells are due to the
                 absence of vinculin even though there may be functions
                 of other focal adhesion complex proteins, e.g., talin,

                 outwardly the positively charged residues of the S4
                 segment. The amount of this displacement is unknown,
                 but large movements of the S4 segment should be
                 constrained by the length and flexibility of the S3-S4
                 linker. To investigate the role of the S3-S4 linker in
                 the ShakerH4Delta(6-46) (ShakerDelta) K(+) channel
                 activation, we constructed S3-S4 linker deletion
                 mutants. Using macropatches of Xenopus oocytes, we
                 tested three constructs: a deletion mutant with no
                 linker (0 aa linker), a mutant containing a linker 5
                 amino acids in length, and a 10 amino acid linker
                 mutant. Each of the three mutants tested yielded robust
                 K(+) currents. The half-activation voltage was shifted
                 to the right along the voltage axis, and the shift was
                 +45 mV in the case of the 0 aa linker channel. In the 0
                 aa linker, mutant deactivation kinetics were sixfold
                 slower than in ShakerDelta. The apparent number of
                 gating charges was 12.6+/-0.6 e(o) in ShakerDelta,
                 12.7+/-0.5 in 10 aa linker, and 12.3+/-0.9 in 5 aa
                 linker channels, but it was only 5.6+/-0.3 e(o) in the
                 0 aa linker mutant channel. The maximum probability of
                 opening (P(o)(max)) as measured using noise analysis
                 was not altered by the linker deletions. Activation
                 kinetics were most affected by linker deletions; at 0
                 mV, the 5 and 0 aa linker channels' activation time
                 constants were 89x and 45x slower than that of the
                 ShakerDelta K(+) channel, respectively. The initial lag
                 of ionic currents when the prepulse was varied from
                 -130 to -60 mV was 0.5, 14, and 2 ms for the 10, 5, and
                 0 aa linker mutant channels, respectively. These
                 results suggest that: (a) the S4 segment moves only a
                 short distance during activation since an S3-S4 linker
                 consisting of only 5 amino acid residues allows for the
                 total charge displacement to occur, and (b) the length
                 of the S3-S4 linker plays an important role in setting
                 ShakerDelta channel activation and deactivation
                 kinetics.",

  abstract =     "Evidence suggests that cell processes can be
                 influenced by weak electromagnetic fields (EMFs). EMFs
                 appear to represent a global interference or stress to
                 which a cell can adapt without catastrophic
                 consequences. There may be exceptions to this
                 observation, however, such as the putative role of EMFs
                 as promoters in the presence of a primary tumor
                 initiator. The nature of the response suggests that the
                 cell is viewing EMFs as it would another subtle
                 environmental change. The age and state of the cell can
                 profoundly affect the EMF bioresponse. There is no
                 evidence that direct posttranscription effects occur as
                 a result of EMF exposure. Although transcription
                 alterations occur, no apparent disruption in routine
                 physiological processes such as growth and division is
                 immediately evident. What is usually observed is a
                 transient perturbation followed by an adjustment by the
                 normal homeostatic machinery of the cells. DNA does not
                 appear to be significantly altered by EMF. If EMF
                 exposure is associated with an increased risk of
                 cancer, the paucity of genotoxic effects would support
                 the suggestion that the fields act in tumor promotion
                 rather than initiation. The site(s) and mechanisms of
                 interaction remain to be elaborated. Although there are
                 numerous studies and hypotheses that suggest the
                 membrane represents the primary site of interaction,
                 there are also several different studies showing that
                 in vitro systems, including cell-free systems, are
                 responsive to EMFs. The debate about potential hazards
                 or therapeutic value of weak electromagnetic fields
                 will continue until the mechanism of interaction has
                 been clarified. [References: 41]",

                 phenomena observed in cells requires the creation and
                 analysis of mathematical models of cellular metabolism
                 and physiology. The formulation and study of such
                 models must also be simplified as far as possible to
                 cope with the increasing complexity demanded and
                 exponential accumulation of the metabolic
                 reconstructions computed from sequenced genomes.
                 RESULTS: A mathematical simulation workbench, DBsolve,
                 has been developed to simplify the derivation and
                 analysis of mathematical models. It combines: (i)
                 derivation of large-scale mathematical models from
                 metabolic reconstructions and other data sources; (ii)
                 solving and parameter continuation of non-linear
                 algebraic equations (NAEs), including metabolic control
                 analysis; (iii) solving the non-linear stiff systems of
                 ordinary differential equations (ODEs); (iv)
                 bifurcation analysis of ODEs; (v) parameter fitting to
                 experimental data or functional criteria based on
                 constrained optimization. The workbench has been
                 successfully used for dynamic metabolic modeling of
                 some typical biochemical networks (Dolgacheva et al.,

                 including microbial glycolytic pathways, signal

                 (received for review April 7, 2002)Previous theoretical
                 approaches to understanding effects of electric fields
                 on cells have used partial differential equations such
                 as Laplace's equation and cell models with simple
                 shapes. Here we describe a transport lattice method
                 illustrated by a didactic multicellular system model
                 with irregular shapes. Each elementary membrane region
                 includes local models for passive membrane resistance
                 and capacitance, nonlinear active sources of the
                 resting potential, and a hysteretic model of
                 electroporation. Field amplification through current or
                 voltage concentration changes with frequency,
                 exhibiting significant spatial heterogeneity until the
                 microwave range is reached, where cellular structure
                 becomes almost electrically invisible. In the time
                 domain, membrane electroporation exhibits significant
                 heterogeneity but occurs mostly at invaginations and
                 cell layers with tight junctions. Such results involve
                 emergent behavior and emphasize the importance of using
                 multicellular models for understanding tissue-level
                 electric field effects in higher organisms.",

                 that are set and maintained by a balance between ion
                 pumps, leaks, and internal ionic equilibria.
                 Previously, a thermodynamic study by Rybak et al.
                 (Rybak, S., F. Lanni, and R. Murphy. 1997. Biophys. J.
                 73:674-687) identified the key elements involved in pH
                 regulation; however, recent experiments show that
                 cellular compartments are not in thermodynamic
                 equilibrium. We present here a nonequilibrium model of
                 lumenal acidification based on the interplay of ion
                 pumps and channels, the physical properties of the
                 lumenal matrix, and the organelle geometry. The model
                 successfully predicts experimentally measured
                 steady-state and transient pH values and membrane
                 potentials. We conclude that morphological differences
                 among organelles are insufficient to explain the wide
                 range of pHs present in the cell. Using sensitivity
                 analysis, we quantified the influence of pH regulatory
                 elements on the dynamics of acidification. We found
                 that V-ATPase proton pump and proton leak densities are
                 the two parameters that most strongly influence resting
                 pH. Additionally, we modeled the pH response of the
                 Golgi complex to varying external solutions, and our
                 findings suggest that the membrane is permeable to more
                 than one dominant counter ion. From this data, we
                 determined a Golgi complex proton permeability of 8.1 x
                 10(-6) cm/s. Furthermore, we analyzed the early-to-late
                 transition in the endosomal pathway where Na,K-ATPases
                 have been shown to limit acidification by an entire pH
                 unit. Our model supports the role of the Na,K-ATPase in
                 regulating endosomal pH by affecting the membrane
                 potential. However, experimental data can only be
                 reproduced by (1) positing the existence of a
                 hypothetical voltage-gated chloride channel or (2) that
                 newly formed vesicles have especially high potassium
                 concentrations and small chloride conductance.",

                 (PKB) and GRP1 (general receptor for

                 protein (GFP) fusion proteins [PH(PKB)GFP and
                 PH(GRP1)GFP respectively] in HEK 293 cells and Swiss
                 3T3 cells, using confocal microscopy. Stimulation of
                 HEK 293 cells with insulin caused a small, but
                 sustained, increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) levels,
                 detected using a radioligand displacement assay, which
                 was mirrored by the translocation of PH(PKB)GFP and
                 PH(GRP1)GFP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane of
                 live, transfected cells. Similar results were obtained
                 using Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated with platelet-derived
                 growth factor (PDGF) and expressing either PH(PKB)GFP
                 or PH(GRP1)GFP. Biochemical analyses confirmed the
                 accumulation of both PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) and
                 PtdIns(3,4)P(2) in response to PDGF, but only the
                 latter was present at increased levels in Swiss 3T3
                 cells 30 min after an oxidative stress (1 mM H(2)O(2)).
                 Concomitantly, only PH(PKB)GFP, and not PH(GRP1)GFP,
                 was localized at plasma membranes after 30 min of
                 treatment with H(2)O(2). The fusion proteins appear
                 accurately to report the spatial and temporal
                 distribution of PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) and PtdIns(3,4)P(2)
                 in intact cells. These results establish the lipid
                 selectivity of these PH domains in vivo, and further
                 emphasize the overlapping, but distinct, second
                 messenger roles of PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) and

                 recently cloned from Discosoma coral by homology to the
                 green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish
                 Aequorea. A core question in the biochemistry of DsRed
                 is the mechanism by which the GFP-like 475-nm
                 excitation and 500-nm emission maxima of immature DsRed
                 are red-shifted to the 558-nm excitation and 583-nm
                 emission maxima of mature DsRed. After digestion of
                 mature DsRed with lysyl endopeptidase, high-resolution
                 mass spectra of the purified chromophore-bearing
                 peptide reveal that some of the molecules have lost 2
                 Da relative to the peptide analogously prepared from a
                 mutant, K83R, that stays green. Tandem mass
                 spectrometry indicates that the bond between the
                 alpha-carbon and nitrogen of Gln-66 has been
                 dehydrogenated in DsRed, extending the GFP chromophore
                 by forming CNCO at the 2-position of the
                 imidazolidinone. This acylimine substituent
                 quantitatively accounts for the red shift according to
                 quantum mechanical calculations. Reversible hydration
                 of the CN bond in the acylimine would explain why
                 denaturation shifts mature DsRed back to a GFP-like
                 absorbance. The CN bond hydrolyses upon boiling,
                 explaining why DsRed shows two fragment bands on
                 SDS/PAGE. This assay suggests that conversion from
                 green to red chromophores remains incomplete even after
                 prolonged aging.",

                 the maintenance of constant amplitudes of cytosolic

                 alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
                 acid (AMPA)/kainate (iGluR) and metabotropic (mGluR)
                 glutamate receptor agonists was studied in the somatic
                 and dendritic regions of cultured cerebellar Purkinje
                 neurons using microscopic video imaging and the Ca2+
                 sensitive dye fura-2. 2. iGluR and mGluR agonists and
                 K+ depolarization applied by brief micropressure pulses
                 evoked Ca2+ signals in both the somatic and dendritic
                 regions of all Purkinje neurons studied. The Ca2+
                 signals were generated simultaneously in both cellular
                 regions. The Ca+ signals to these stimulants were
                 similar in general form, consisting of an initial peak
                 and slow recovery phase, but differed in details of
                 amplitude, time course, and complexity. 3. Removal of
                 extracellular Ca2+ abolished the Ca2+ signal to the
                 iGluR agonist AMPA, indicating that Ca2+ influx was
                 essential to the generation of Ca2+ signals by iGluR
                 agonists. The Ca2+ channel blocker lanthanum almost
                 completely eliminated the Ca2+ signals to AMPA,
                 indicating that Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive
                 Ca2+ channels was the main pathway for Ca2+ influx.
                 Omega-agatoxin IVA, a P-type Ca2+ channel blocker,
                 significantly reduced the Ca2+ signals to AMPA
                 suggesting that Ca2+ influx was predominately through
                 P-type Ca2+ channels. 4. Pharmacological manipulation
                 of intracellular Ca2+ stores significantly reduced the
                 Ca2+ signals to AMPA, indicating that release of Ca2+
                 from intracellular Ca2+ stores also plays a prominent
                 role in the generation of the Ca2+ signals to iGluR
                 agonists. These manipulations included blocking Ca2+
                 release from intracellular stores with dantrolene, an
                 antagonist at the ryanodine receptor that controls Ca2+
                 release from one pool of intracellular Ca2+ stores, and
                 depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with caffeine or
                 ryanodine. 5. Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive
                 Ca2+ channels did not appear to be involved in the Ca2+
                 signals to mGluR activation, because neither lanthanum
                 nor omega-agatoxin IVA altered Ca2+ signals to mGluR
                 agonists. Manipulation of intracellular stores with
                 Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitors and dantrolene significantly
                 reduced the Ca2+ signal to mGluR agonists, indicating
                 that Ca2+ signals were derived from both the inositol
                 trisphosphate (IP3) and the ryanodine
                 receptor-controlled intracellular Ca2+ stores. 6. Ca2+
                 signals to the iGluR agonist AMPA correlated temporally
                 with the prolonged, multiphasic membrane responses
                 elicited by similar agonist application in parallel
                 electrophysiological studies. Pharmacological
                 manipulation of Ca2+ influx and release of Ca2+ from
                 intracellular stores significantly influenced
                 components of the membrane response to AMPA, indicating
                 a potential modulator or mediator role for Ca2+ in the
                 membrane response to iGluR activation.",

                 channel blockers, thereby offering a basis for the
                 detection of a variety of organic molecules with
                 alphaHL as a biosensor element. To further such
                 studies, it is important to find conditions under which
                 the dwell time of cyclodextrins in the lumen of the
                 pore is extended. Here, we use single-channel recording
                 to explore the pH- and voltage-dependence of the
                 interaction of beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD) with alphaHL.
                 betaCD can access its binding site only from the trans
                 entrance of pores inserted from the cis side of a
                 bilayer. Analysis of the binding kinetics shows that
                 there is a single binding site for betaCD, with an
                 apparent equilibrium dissociation constant that varies
                 by >100-fold under the conditions explored. The
                 dissociation rate constant for the neutral betaCD
                 molecule varies with pH and voltage, a result that is
                 incompatible with two states of the alphaHL pore, one
                 of high and the other of low affinity. Rather, the data
                 suggest that the actual equilibrium dissociation

                 by immunodepletion of its activator MEK, or by addition
                 of the MEK inhibitor PD98059, caused precocious
                 termination of mitosis and interfered with production
                 of normal mitotic microtubules. Sustained activation of
                 MAPK arrested extracts in mitosis in the absence of

                 Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial permeability transition

  abstract =     "Mitochondria contain a sophisticated system for
                 transporting Ca2+. The existence of a uniporter and of
                 both Na+-dependent and -independent efflux mechanisms
                 has been known for years. Recently, a new mechanism,
                 called the RaM, which seems adapted for sequestering
                 Ca2+ from physiological transients or pulses has been
                 discovered. The RaM shows a conductivity at the
                 beginning of a Ca2+ pulse that is much higher than the
                 conductivity of the uniporter. This conductivity
                 decreases very rapidly following the increase in [Ca2+]
                 outside the mitochondria. This decrease in the Ca2+
                 conductivity of the RaM is associated with binding of
                 Ca2+ to an external regulatory site. When liver
                 mitochondria are exposed to a sequence of pulses,
                 uptake of labeled Ca2+ via the RaM appears additive
                 between pulses. Ruthenium red inhibits the RaM in liver
                 mitochondria but much larger amounts are required than
                 for inhibition of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter.
                 Spermine, ATP and GTP increase Ca2+ uptake via the RaM.
                 Maximum uptake via the RaM from a single Ca2+ pulse in
                 the physiological range has been observed to be
                 approximately 7 nmole/mg protein, suggesting that Ca2+
                 uptake via the RaM and uniporter from physiological
                 pulses may be sufficient to activate the Ca2+-sensitive
                 metabolic reactions in the mitochondrial matrix which
                 increase the rate of ATP production. RaM-mediated Ca2+
                 uptake has also been observed in heart
                 mitochondria.Evidence for Ca2+ uptake into the
                 mitochondria in a variety of tissues described in the
                 literature is reviewed for evidence of participation of
                 the RaM in this uptake. Possible ways in which the
                 differences in transport via the RaM and the uniporter
                 may be used to differentiate between metabolic and
                 apoptotic signaling are discussed. [References: 75]",

                 InsP(3) and ATP was explored in detail using planar
                 lipid bilayers. In comparison to the type I InsP(3)R,
                 the type III InsP(3)R required a higher concentration

                 activation by InsP(3) was isoform-specific, regulation

                 of 2 microM InsP(3), low ATP concentrations (<6 mM)
                 increased the open probability and mean open time. High

                 These results illustrate the complex nature of type III

                 Three isoforms have been identified, but only types I
                 and II InsP3R have been characterized. Here we examine
                 the functional properties of the type III InsP3R
                 because this receptor is restricted to the trigger zone
                 from which Ca2+ waves originate and it has distinctive
                 InsP3-binding properties. We find that type III InsP3R
                 forms Ca2+ channels with single-channel currents that
                 are similar to those of type I InsP3R; however, the
                 open probability of type III InsP3R isoform increases
                 monotonically with increased cytoplasmic Ca2+
                 concentration, whereas the type I isoform has a
                 bell-shaped dependence on cytoplasmic Ca2+. The
                 properties of type III InsP3R provide positive feedback
                 as Ca2+ is released; the lack of negative feedback
                 allows complete Ca2+ release from intracellular stores.
                 Thus, activation of type III InsP3R in cells that
                 express only this isoform results in a single
                 transient, but global, increase in the concentration of
                 cytosolic Ca2+. The bell-shaped Ca2+-dependence curve
                 of type I InsP3R is ideal for supporting Ca2+
                 oscillations, whereas the properties of type III InsP3R
                 are better suited to signal initiation.",

                 [Ca2+]c oscillations directly with the activity of
                 Ca(2+)-regulated targets. We have studied the control
                 of Ca(2+)-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases

                 sustained [Ca2+]c increases yielded only transient
                 CSMDH activation, and slow or partial [Ca2+]c
                 elevations were ineffective in increasing [Ca2+]m or
                 stimulating CSMDHs. We conclude that the mitochondria
                 are tuned to oscillating [Ca2+]c signals, the frequency

                 (IP3) and Ca2+ on the IP3 receptor Ca2+ release channel
                 (IP3R) is a fundamental step in the generation of
                 cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations and waves, which underlie
                 Ca2+ signaling in many cells. Mitochondria appear in
                 close association with regions of endoplasmic reticulum
                 (ER) enriched in IP3R and are particularly responsive
                 to IP3-induced increases of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c).
                 To determine whether feedback regulation of the IP3R by
                 released Ca2+ is modulated by mitochondrial Ca2+
                 uptake, the interactions between ER and mitochondrial
                 Ca2+ pools were examined by fluorescence imaging of
                 compartmentalized Ca2+ indicators in permeabilized
                 hepatocytes. IP3 decreased luminal ER Ca2+ ([Ca2+]ER),
                 and this was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial
                 matrix Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) and activation of Ca2+-sensitive
                 mitochondrial metabolism. Remarkably, the decrease in
                 [Ca2+]ER evoked by submaximal IP3 was enhanced when
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was blocked with ruthenium
                 red or uncoupler. Moreover, subcellular regions that
                 were relatively deficient in mitochondria demonstrated
                 greater sensitivity to IP3 than regions of the cell
                 with a high density of mitochondria. These data
                 demonstrate that Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria
                 suppresses the local positive feedback effects of Ca2+
                 on the IP3R, giving rise to subcellular heterogeneity
                 in IP3 sensitivity and IP3R excitability. Thus,
                 mitochondria can play an important role in setting the
                 threshold for activation and establishing the

                 detected in half the eggs studied. Although we were
                 unable to detect a widespread loss of PtdIns(4,5)P2, we
                 found that fertilization triggers a net increase in
                 plasma membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 that is localized to the
                 vegetal cortex. The fertilization-induced increase in
                 PtdIns(4,5)P2 follows the increase in Ca2+, is blocked
                 by Ca2+ buffers and can be mimicked, albeit with slower
                 kinetics, by photoreleasing Ins(1,4,5)P3. Inhibition of
                 Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of cortical granules, without
                 interfering with Ca2+ transients, inhibits the
                 PtdIns(4,5)P2 increase. The increase appears to be due
                 to de novo synthesis since it is inhibited by
                 micromolar wortmannin. Finally, there is no increase in
                 PtdIns(4,5)P2 in immature oocytes that are not
                 competent to extrude cortical granules. These studies
                 suggest that fertilization does not deplete plasma
                 membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 and that one of the pathways for
                 increasing PtdIns(4,5)P2 at fertilization is invoked by
                 exocytosis of cortical granules.",

  abstract =     "This paper reviews the model of the control of
                 mitochondrial substrate oxidation by Ca2+ ions. The
                 mechanism is the activation by Ca2+ of four
                 mitochondrial dehydrogenases, viz. glycerol 3-phosphate
                 dehydrogenase, the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme
                 complex (PDH), NAD-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase
                 (NAD-IDH) and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH). This
                 results in the increase, or near-maintenance, of
                 mitochondrial NADH/NAD ratios in the activated state,
                 depending upon the tissue and the degree of
                 'downstream' activation by Ca2+, likely at the level of
                 the F1Fo ATPase. Higher values of the redox span of the
                 respiratory chain allow for greatly increased fluxes
                 through oxidative phosphorylation with a minimal drop
                 in protonmotive force and phosphorylation potential. As
                 PDH, NAD-IDH and OGDH are all located within the inner
                 mitochondrial membrane, it is changes in matrix free
                 Ca2+ [Ca2+]m which act as a signal to these activities.
                 In this article, we review recent work in which [Ca2+]m
                 is measured in cells and tissues, using different
                 techniques, with special emphasis on the question of
                 the degree of damping of [Ca2+]m relative to changes in
                 cytosol free Ca2+ in cells with rapid transients in
                 cytosol Ca2+, e.g. cardiac myocytes. Further, we put
                 forward the point of view that the failure of
                 mitochondrial energy transduction to keep pace with
                 cellular energy needs in some forms of heart failure
                 may involve a failure of [Ca2+]m to be raised
                 adequately to allow the activation of the
                 dehydrogenases. We present new data to show that this
                 is so in cardiac myocytes isolated from animals
                 suffering from chronic, streptozocin-induced diabetes.
                 This raises the possibility of therapy based upon
                 partial inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux
                 pathways, thereby raising [Ca2+]m at a given,
                 time-average value of cytosol free Ca+2.",

                 3-dimensional reconstructions of dendritic spines from
                 Purkinje spiny branchlets of normal adult rats to
                 evaluate 2 questions about the relationship of spine
                 geometry to synaptic efficacy. First, do relationships
                 between spine geometry and other anatomical indicators
                 of synaptic activity suggest that spine size and shape
                 might be associated with synaptic efficacy?
                 Reconstructed spines were graphically edited into head
                 and neck compartments; the area of the postsynaptic
                 density (PSD) was measured; the volume of spine smooth
                 endoplasmic reticulum (SER) was computed; and all of
                 the vesicles in the axonal varicosities were counted.
                 Spine head volume and the volume of SER contained in
                 the head are well correlated with the area of the PSD
                 and the number of vesicles in the presynaptic axonal
                 varicosity. Spine neck diameter does not fluctuate with
                 PSD area, head volume, or the vesicle number. These
                 results suggest that the dimensions of the spine head,
                 but not of the spine neck, are likely to reflect
                 differences in synaptic efficacy. Second, does the
                 geometry of cerebellar spine necks reduce the transfer
                 of synaptic charge to the recipient dendrite from the
                 theoretical maximum that could be transferred if the
                 synapse were on a dendritic shaft? Comparison of volume
                 to surface area showed that the spine heads are
                 approximately spherical and the necks are approximately
                 cylindrical. Application of results from a biophysical
                 model that assumed these geometrical shapes for spines
                 (Wilson, 1984) showed that the cerebellar spine necks
                 are unlikely to reduce transfer of synaptic charge by
                 more than 5-20\% even if their SER were to completely
                 block passage of current through the portion of the
                 neck that it occupies. We suggest that the constricted
                 spine neck diameter might serve to isolate metabolic
                 events in the vicinity of activated synapses by
                 reducing diffusion to neighboring synapses, without
                 significantly influencing the transfer of synaptic
                 charge to the postsynaptic dendrite.",

                 steady-state reaction rate of an intracellular enzyme,
                 recruited to the plasma membrane by active receptors,
                 acting upon a membrane-associated substrate. Influenced
                 by physical and chemical effects, such interactions are
                 encountered in numerous signal-transduction pathways.
                 The generalized modeling framework is the first to
                 combine reaction and diffusion limitations in enzyme
                 action, the finite mean lifetime of receptor-enzyme
                 complexes, reactions in the bulk membrane, and
                 constitutive and receptor-mediated substrate insertion.
                 The theory is compared with other analytical and
                 numerical approaches, and it is used to model two
                 different signaling pathway types. For two-state
                 mechanisms, such as activation of the Ras GTPase, the
                 diffusion-limited activation rate constant increases
                 with enhanced substrate inactivation, dissociation of
                 receptor-enzyme complexes, or crowding of neighboring
                 complexes. The latter effect is only significant when
                 nearly all of the substrate is in the activated state.
                 For regulated supply and turnover pathways, such as
                 phospholipase C-mediated lipid hydrolysis, an
                 additional influence is receptor-mediated substrate
                 delivery. When substrate consumption is rapid, this
                 process significantly enhances the effective enzymatic
                 rate constant, regardless of whether enzyme action is

                 yielded dielectrically weighted distances between
                 cofactors. They were related to the one between YZox
                 and QA- (=100\%). The electron transfer from YZ to
                 P680+ ranged over a relative distance of 15\%, while
                 the one from Mn4 to YZox ranged over less than 3.5\%.
                 The latter result placed Mn4 and YZ at about the same
                 weighted depth in the membrane. The oxidation of
                 cofactor X by YZox during S2 --> S3 ranged over 10\%.
                 We tentatively attributed 7\% to proton transfer into
                 the lumen and 3\% to electron transfer, in line with
                 our notion that one proton is liberated from Xox
                 itself. This placed X at the same depth in the membrane
                 as Mn. Proton release upon the final oxidation of water

  abstract =     "1. The properties of glutamate receptor (GluR)
                 channels in outside-out patches from the dendrites and
                 somata of rat cerebellar Purkinje cells in brain slice
                 were studied using fast agonist application techniques.
                 Dendritic patches were isolated 40-130 micronm from the
                 soma. 2. Outside-out patches from both dendrites and
                 somata of Purkinje cells responded to application of
                 glutamate with a current which desensitized rapidly and
                 nearly completely. Currents evoked by glutamate
                 application were blocked by
                 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), were
                 mimicked by
                 L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate
                 (AMPA), and were modulated by cyclothiazide. Kainate
                 produced small, non-desensitizing currents. No currents
                 were observed in response to aspartate application.
                 Responses characteristic of NMDA receptor activation
                 were not observed. These findings indicate that
                 glutamate-activated currents were mediated by the AMPA
                 subtype of GluR. 3. Deactivation of the GluR channels
                 following 1 ms pulses of glutamate occurred with a time
                 constant of 1.23 +/- 0.07 ms in dendritic and 1.12 +/-
                 0.04 ms in somatic patches. Desensitization occurred
                 with a time constant of 5.37 +/- 0.26 ms in dendritic
                 and 5.29 +/- 0.29 ms in somatic patches. The time
                 constant of recovery from desensitization caused by a 1
                 ms application of 1 mM glutamate was 36 ms in dendritic
                 patches and 33 ms in somatic patches. 4. Half-maximal
                 activation of the GluR channels was achieved at a
                 glutamate concentration of 432 microM. Deactivation
                 kinetics were not dependent on the glutamate
                 concentration, while desensitization became slower at
                 lower glutamate concentrations. 5. Pre-equilibration of
                 patches with low concentrations of glutamate reduced
                 the peak current activated by 1 mM glutamate. The IC50
                 for this effect was 8.7 microM. Equilibrium
                 desensitization did not affect the kinetics of the
                 current activated by 1 mM glutamate. 6. The
                 current-voltage relationship of the peak current was
                 linear in normal Na(+)-rich external solution, with a
                 reversal potential near 0 mV. In Ca(2+) -rich external
                 solution, the reversal potentials were -51.4 +/- 2.9
                 and -51.5 +/- 2.8 mV for dendritic and somatic patches,
                 respectively, indicating that these glutamate channels
                 have a low permeability to Ca2+ (PCa/PCa = 0.053). 7.
                 The mean single-channel conductance of the GluR
                 channels measured using non-stationary fluctuation
                 analysis was approximately 8 pS in dendritic and
                 somatic patches, and the maximum open probability was
                 at least 0.7 with 5 mM glutamate. 8. GluR channel
                 kinetics in patches excised from the soma of neonatal
                 (postnatal day 4; P4) Purkinje cells, before the
                 development of the dendritic arborization of the
                 Purkinje cell, were similar to those in patches excised
                 from more mature (P12-18) Purkinje cells. 9. Dendritic
                 and somatic GluR channels in Purkinje cells appear to
                 be functionally identical, are AMPA-subtype receptors
                 containing the GluR-B subunit, and have rapid kinetics
                 and low permeability to Ca2+. A kinetic model was
                 constructed which faithfully reproduces the gating
                 characteristics of the GluR channels.",

  abstract =     "The membrane potential is an important modulator of
                 calcium ion flux into endothelial cells of venular
                 microvessels. We developed a method to measure the
                 membrane potential of endothelial cells forming the
                 walls of individually perfused microvessels under the
                 same experimental conditions as those used to measure
                 cytoplasmic calcium concentration and microvessel
                 permeability. The membrane potential-sensitive
                 fluorescent dye, bis-oxonol (1 microM), was added to
                 the perfusate and the changes in bis-oxonol
                 fluorescence intensity (FI) were calibrated in terms of
                 changes in membrane potential using the cationic
                 ionophore, gramicidin. FI changes an average of 0.625\%
                 per millivolt. The resting membrane potential of
                 endothelial cells measured in single perfused
                 microvessels, each calibrated individually, was 51.6
                 +/- 4.9 mV (n = 9). In the presence of high potassium
                 Ringer's solutions (57.9 and 100 mM, [K+]o), the
                 membrane depolarized 25 +/- 3 and 40 +/- 5 mV,
                 respectively. Conversely, low potassium solutions (0.1
                 mM [K+]o) hyperpolarized the membrane by 23 +/- 4 mV.
                 The endothelial membrane was also depolarized when the
                 Na-K-ATPase was inhibited with ouabain. This method
                 provides new data to test current hypotheses describing
                 the role of the endothelial cell membrane potential as
                 a modulator of microvessel permeability.",

                 probes relies on understanding their molecular
                 spectroscopy, dynamics, and structure. Here, the
                 photophysics of red fluorescent protein (dsRed) from
                 discosoma (coral), providing desired longer
                 emission/absorption wavelengths, and an improved yellow
                 fluorescent protein mutant (Citrine) (S65G/V68L/Q69
                 M/S72A/T203Y) for significant comparison, are
                 characterized by using fluorescence correlation
                 spectroscopy and time-correlated single-photon
                 counting. dsRed fluorescence decays as a single
                 exponential with a 3.65 +/- 0.07-ns time constant,
                 indicating a single emitting state/species independent
                 of pH 4.4-9.0, in contrast with Citrine. However, laser
                 excitation drives reversible fluorescence flicker at
                 10(3)-10(4) Hz between dark and bright states with a
                 constant partition fraction f(1) = 0.42 +/- 0.06 and
                 quantum yield of approximately 3 x 10(-3). Unlike
                 Citrine (pKa approximately 5.7), pH-dependent proton
                 binding is negligible (pH 3. 9-11) in dsRed.
                 Time-resolved anisotropy of dsRed reveals rapid
                 depolarization (211 +/- 6 ps) plus slow rotational
                 motion (53 +/- 8 ns), in contrast with a single
                 rotational time (16 +/- 2 ns) for Citrine. The
                 molecular dimensions, calculated from rotational and
                 translational diffusion, indicate that dsRed is
                 hydrodynamically 3.8 +/- 0.4 times larger than
                 predicted for a monomer, which suggests an oligomer
                 (possibly a tetramer) configuration even at
                 approximately 10(-9) M. The fast depolarization is
                 attributed to intraoligomer energy transfer between
                 mobile nonparallel chromophores with the initial
                 anisotropy implying a 24 +/- 3 degrees depolarization
                 angle. Large two-photon excitation cross sections (
                 approximately 100 GM at 990 nm for dsRed and
                 approximately 50 GM at 970 nm for Citrine),

                 inhibition of voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels,
                 (I(Ca)), was tested in voltage-clamped bovine adrenal

                 m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP), the blocker of the
                 Ca(2+) uniporter ruthenium red (RR), and a combination
                 of oligomycin plus rotenone were used to interfere with
                 mitochondrial Ca(2+) buffering. In cells dialyzed with
                 an EGTA-free solution, peak I(Ca) generated by 20 msec
                 pulses to 0 or +10 mV, applied at 15 sec intervals,
                 from a holding potential of -80 mV, decayed rapidly
                 after superfusion of cells with 2 microm CCCP (tau =
                 16.7 +/- 3 sec; n = 8). In cells dialyzed with 14 mm
                 EGTA, CCCP did not provoke I(Ca) loss. Cell dialysis
                 with 4 microm ruthenium red or cell superfusion with
                 oligomycin (3 microm) plus rotenone (4 microm) also
                 accelerated the decay of I(Ca). After treatment with
                 CCCP, decay of N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+) channel currents
                 occurred faster than that of L-type Ca(2+) channel
                 currents. These data are compatible with the idea that
                 the elevation of the bulk cytosolic Ca(2+)
                 concentration, [Ca(2+)](c), causes the inhibition of L-
                 and N- as well as P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels expressed by
                 bovine chromaffin cells. This [Ca(2+)](c) signal
                 appears to be tightly regulated by rapid Ca(2+) uptake
                 into mitochondria. Thus, it is plausible that
                 mitochondria might efficiently regulate the activity of
                 L, N, and P/Q Ca(2+) channels under physiological

                 neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid cell line. In these cells
                 bradykinin rapidly hydrolyses PtdIns(4,5)P2 to InsP3
                 and DG, raises intracellular Ca2+ and hyperpolarizes
                 then depolarizes the cell membrane. By voltage-clamp
                 recording we show that the hyperpolarization results
                 from the activation pharmacologically-identifiable
                 species of Ca2+-dependent K+ current. This is also
                 activated by intracellular injections of Ca2+ or InsP3
                 so may be attributed to the formation and action of
                 InsP3. The subsequent depolarization results primarily
                 from the inhibition of a different, voltage-dependent
                 K+ current, the M-current that is also inhibited by DG
                 activators. Hence we describe for the first time a
                 dual, time-dependent role for these two intracellular
                 messengers in the control of neuronal signalling by a
                 peptide.",

                 Methacholine produced an inward current with a

                 produced a transient outward (hyperpolarizing) current.
                 In NG108-15 cells, BK also induced an inward
                 (depolarizing) current associated with a decrease in
                 input membrane conductance, which results from the
                 inhibition of a voltage-sensitive potassium current,
                 the M-current. However, in NL308 cells, either no
                 depolarization was elicited by BK or, even if the
                 BK-induced depolarization was evoked, it was associated
                 with an increased conductance. To explain the above
                 difference, the intracellular second messenger system
                 of NL308 cells was examined in detail. BK induced the
                 rapid accumulation (three- to fivefold higher than the
                 control level) of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)
                 in NL308 cells. The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was
                 also elevated to 540 nM from 180 nM at a basal level.
                 This seems to be enough to activate a
                 voltage-independent and Ca2(+)-sensitive K+ current,
                 resulting in the hyperpolarization. Intracellular
                 injection of InsP3 replicated the hyperpolarization.
                 NL308 cells possess protein kinase C (C-kinase), with
                 specific activities of C-kinase in cytosolic and
                 membrane fractions being 233 and 24 pmol/min/mg
                 protein, respectively. The activity associated with
                 particulates became higher after phorbol dibutyrate
                 (PDBu) treatment. But NL308 cells did not show the
                 characteristic inward relaxation by step
                 hyperpolarizations and the outward rectification in the
                 current-voltage relationship, indicating that the M
                 current is deficient in NL308 cells. Therefore,
                 application of PDBu failed to mimic the inward current.
                 The results suggest the role of InsP3 and C-kinase in
                 controlling two K+ currents.",

                 examined in neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells. Using
                 wild-type and a dominant-negative form of p160ROCK and
                 a p160ROCK-specific inhibitor, Y-27632, we show here
                 that p160ROCK activation is necessary and sufficient
                 for the agonist-induced neurite retraction and cell
                 rounding. The neurite retraction was accompanied by
                 elevated phosphorylation of myosin light chain and the
                 disassembly of the intermediate filaments and
                 microtubules. Y-27632 blocked both neurite retraction
                 and the elevation of myosin light chain phosphorylation
                 in a similar concentration-dependent manner. On the
                 other hand, suppression of p160ROCK activity by
                 expression of a dominant-negative form of p160ROCK
                 induced neurites in the presence of serum by inducing
                 the reassembly of the intermediate filaments and
                 microtubules. The neurite outgrowth by the p160ROCK
                 inhibition was blocked by coexpression of
                 dominant-negative forms of Cdc42 and Rac, indicating
                 that p160ROCK constitutively and negatively regulates

                 via the bathing solution ([Ca2+]B). Changing [Ca2+]B
                 had only an effect on [Ca2+]i if the cells were
                 depolarized by raising the extracellular K+
                 concentration. Surprisingly, raising [Ca2+]B from 2 to
                 10 mm caused a decrease in [Ca2+]i, and an increase was
                 evoked by reducing [Ca2+]B to 0.1 mm. These changes
                 were not due to shifts in membrane potential. At low
                 [Ca2+]B moderate membrane depolarizations were
                 sufficient to evoke a [Ca2+]i increase, while
                 progressively larger depolarizations were necessary at

                 the electrochemical Ca2+ gradient and the surface
                 potential at the extracellular side of the plasma
                 membrane. These two parameters are affected in a
                 counteracting way: Raising the extracellular Ca2+
                 concentration enhances the electrochemical Ca2+
                 gradient and hence Ca2+ influx, but it attenuates Ca2+
                 channel activity by shifting the extracellular surface
                 potential to the positive direction, and vice versa.",

                 ([Ca2+]cyt) often use Ca2+ as a messenger to activate
                 intramitochondrial metabolic processes. However, the
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ level also regulates the activation
                 of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), a
                 process that involves the assembly of a high
                 conductance proteinaceous pore across the inner and
                 outer membrane. Studies on intact liver cells indicate
                 that the MPT is a critical step in the cell killing
                 induced by anoxia or respiratory inhibitors. In this
                 study, we used freshly isolated hepatocytes to
                 investigate to what extent the elevation of [Ca2+]cyt
                 by vasopressin or other agonists causes Ca2+
                 accumulation in the mitochondria and how this treatment
                 affects the mitochondrial susceptibility to undergo the
                 MPT. Hepatocytes were incubated with vasopressin,
                 glucagon, or with thapsigargin (an inhibitor of the
                 endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump) prior to
                 permeabilization with digitonin. Mitochondrial Ca2+
                 accumulation was determined by following the
                 ionomycin-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized cells
                 and mitochondrial swelling was studied by following
                 cyclosporin A-sensitive light scattering changes
                 induced by phenyl-arsenoxide and rotenone. The results
                 indicate that agents that elevate [Ca2+]cyt cause a
                 significant Ca2+ accumulation in the mitochondria.
                 Excessive Ca2+ accumulation (> 10-fold increase over
                 basal levels) was obtained with the combination of
                 vasopressin and glucagon or with incubations containing
                 thapsigargin. These conditions were also associated
                 with a marked increase in rotenone-induced
                 mitochondrial swelling. However, the more modest
                 increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ content after treating
                 cells with vasopressin alone did not enhance the
                 swelling response; instead, vasopressin suppressed
                 mitochondrial swelling compared to control incubations.
                 Vasopressin also partly suppressed the swelling
                 associated with thapsigargin treatment, although it did
                 not significantly affect the Ca2+ accumulation under
                 these conditions. This effect of vasopressin was
                 mimicked by phorbol ester, suggesting a role for
                 protein kinase C. The data indicate that mitochondrial
                 Ca2+ accumulation following elevation of elevation of
                 [Ca2+]cyt enhances the susceptibility for activation of
                 the MPT, a response that may increase cell injury
                 during anoxia or in response to other challenges.
                 However, hormones also activate protective responses in
                 the cell that suppress the MPT.",

  abstract =     "Intra-sarcomeric gradients of [Ca2+] during activation
                 of action potential stimulated frog single fibres were
                 investigated with the Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 and
                 confocal and two-photon microscopy. The object of these
                 experiments was to look for evidence of
                 extra-junctional Ca2+ release and examine the
                 microscopic diffusion of Ca2+ within the sarcomere. By
                 exploiting the spatial periodicity of sarcomeres within
                 the fibre, we could achieve a high effective
                 line-scanning rate ( approximately 8000 lines s-1),
                 although the laser scanning microscope was limited to <
                 1000 lines s-1. At this high time resolution, the time
                 course of fluorescence changes was very different at
                 the z- and m-lines, with a significant delay (
                 approximately 1 ms; 22 C) between the rise of
                 fluorescence at the z-line and the m-line. To calculate
                 the expected fluorescence changes, we used a
                 multi-compartment model of Ca2+ movements in the
                 half-sarcomere in which Ca2+ release was restricted to
                 triadic junctions (located at z-lines). Optical
                 blurring by the microscope was simulated to generate
                 fluorescence signals which could be compared directly
                 to experimental data. The model which reproduced our
                 experimental findings most accurately included Ca2+
                 binding by ATP, as well as indicator binding to
                 immobile sarcomeric proteins. After taking sarcomeric
                 misregistration within the fibre into account, there
                 was very good agreement between the model and
                 experimental results. We conclude that there is no
                 experimental evidence for Ca2+ release at locations
                 other than at z-lines. In addition, our calculations
                 support the conclusion that rapidly diffusing Ca2+
                 buffers (such as ATP) are important in shaping the Ca2+
                 transient and that the details of intracellular
                 indicator binding need to be considered to explain
                 correctly the time course of fluorescence change in the
                 fibre.",

                 (KATP) channels have more recently also been identified
                 within the inner mitochondrial membrane. Yet the
                 consequences of mitochondrial KATP channel activation
                 on mitochondrial function remain partially documented.
                 Therefore, we isolated mitochondria from rat hearts and
                 used K+ channel openers to examine the effect of
                 mitochondrial KATP channel opening on mitochondrial
                 membrane potential, respiration, ATP generation, Ca2+
                 transport, and matrix volume. From a mitochondrial
                 membrane potential of -180 +/- 15 mV, K+ channel
                 openers, pinacidil (100 microM), cromakalim (25
                 microM), and levcromakalim (20 microM), induced
                 membrane depolarization by 10 +/-7, 25 +/- 9, and 24
                 +/- 10 mV, respectively. This effect was abolished by
                 removal of extramitochondrial K+ or application of a
                 KATP channel blocker. K+ channel opener-induced
                 membrane depolarization was associated with an increase
                 in the rate of mitochondrial respiration and a decrease
                 in the rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis.
                 Furthermore, treatment with a K+ channel opener
                 released Ca2+ from mitochondria preloaded with Ca2+, an
                 effect also dependent on extramitochondrial K+
                 concentration and sensitive to KATP channel blockade.
                 In addition, K+ channel openers, cromakalim and
                 pinacidil, increased matrix volume and released
                 mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome c and adenylate
                 kinase. Thus, in isolated cardiac mitochondria, KATP
                 channel openers depolarized the membrane, accelerated
                 respiration, slowed ATP production, released
                 accumulated Ca2+, produced swelling, and stimulated
                 efflux of intermembrane proteins. These observations
                 provide direct evidence for a role of mitochondrial
                 KATP channels in regulating functions vital for the

                 system is guided by diffusible or bound factors that

                 cytoplasmic signalling mechanisms that trigger the
                 responses of the growth cone to guidance factors are
                 mostly unknown. Previous studies have shown that the
                 level and temporal patterns of cytoplasmic Ca2+ can
                 regulate the rate of growth-cone extension in vitro and
                 in vivo. Here we report that Ca2+ also mediates the
                 turning behaviour of the growth cones of cultured
                 Xenopus neurons that are induced by an extracellular
                 gradient of netrin-1, an established diffusible
                 guidance factor in vivo. The netrin-1-induced turning
                 response depends on Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane
                 Ca2+ channels, as well as Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release
                 from cytoplasmic stores. Reduction of Ca2+ signals by
                 blocking either of these two Ca2+ sources converted the
                 netrin-1-induced response from attraction to repulsion.
                 Activation of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from internal
                 stores with a gradient of ryanodine in the absence of
                 netrin-1 was sufficient to trigger either attractive or
                 repulsive responses, depending on the ryanodine
                 concentration used. These results support the model
                 that cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals mediate growth-cone
                 guidance by netrin-1, and different patterns of Ca2+
                 elevation trigger attractive and repulsive turning

                 N.B. Pivovarova, S.B. Andrews, and D.D. Friel. 2001. J.
                 Gen. Physiol. 118:83-100) shows that in sympathetic
                 neurons, small [Ca(2)+](i) elevations evoked by weak
                 depolarization stimulate ER Ca accumulation, but at a
                 rate attenuated by activation of a ryanodine-sensitive
                 CICR pathway. Here, we have measured
                 depolarization-evoked changes in total ER Ca
                 concentration ([Ca](ER)) as a function of [Ca(2)+](i),
                 and found that progressively larger [Ca(2)+](i)
                 elevations cause a graded transition from ER Ca
                 accumulation to net release, consistent with the
                 expression of multiple modes of CICR. [Ca](ER) is
                 relatively high at rest (12.8 +/- 0.9 mmol/kg dry
                 weight, mean +/- SEM) and is reduced by thapsigargin or
                 ryanodine (5.5 +/- 0.7 and 4.7 +/- 1.1 mmol/kg,
                 respectively). [Ca](ER) rises during weak
                 depolarization (to 17.0 +/- 1.6 mmol/kg over 120s,
                 [Ca(2)+](i) less than approximately 350 nM), changes
                 little in response to stronger depolarization (12.1
                 +/-1.1 mmol/kg, [Ca(2)+](i) approximately 700 nM), and
                 declines (to 6.5 +/-1.0 mmol/kg) with larger
                 [Ca(2)+](i) elevations (>1 microM) evoked by the same
                 depolarization when mitochondrial Ca(2)+ uptake is
                 inhibited (FCCP). Thus, net ER Ca(2)+ transport
                 exhibits a biphasic dependence on [Ca(2)+](i). With
                 mitochondrial Ca(2)+ uptake enabled, [Ca](ER) rises
                 after repolarization (to 16.6 +/- 1.8 mmol/kg at 15
                 min) as [Ca(2)+](i) falls within the permissive range
                 for ER Ca accumulation over a period lengthened by
                 mitochondrial Ca(2)+ release. Finally, although
                 spatially averaged [Ca](ER) is unchanged during strong
                 depolarization, net ER Ca(2)+ release still occurs, but
                 only in the outermost approximately 5-microm
                 cytoplasmic shell where [Ca(2)+](i) should reach its
                 highest levels. Since mitochondrial Ca accumulation
                 occurs preferentially in peripheral cytoplasm, as
                 demonstrated here by electron energy loss Ca maps, the
                 Ca content of ER and mitochondria exhibit reciprocal
                 dependencies on proximity to sites of Ca(2)+ entry,
                 possibly reflecting indirect mitochondrial regulation
                 of ER Ca(2)+ transport.",

                 potentials has been widely used in studies of normal
                 and pathological heart rhythms and defibrillation. In
                 these studies, three-dimensional spatio-temporal events
                 can only be inferred from two-dimensional surface
                 potential maps. We present a novel optical system that
                 enables high fidelity transmural recording of
                 transmembrane potentials. A probe constructed from
                 optical fibers is used to deliver excitation light and
                 collect fluorescence from seven positions, each 1 mm
                 apart, through the left ventricle wall of the rabbit
                 heart. Excitation is provided by the 488-nm line of a
                 water-cooled argon-ion laser. The fluorescence of the
                 voltage-sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS from each tissue site
                 is split at 600 nm and imaged onto separate photodiodes
                 for later signal ratioing. The optics and electronics
                 are easily expandable to accommodate multiple optical
                 probes. The system is used to record the first
                 simultaneous measurements of transmembrane potential at

                 (FRET) between fluorescently labeled molecules can
                 measure the timing and location of intermolecular
                 interactions inside living cells. Present microscopic
                 methods measure FRET in arbitrary units, and cannot
                 discriminate FRET efficiency and the fractions of donor
                 and acceptor in complex. Here we describe a
                 stoichiometric method that uses three microscopic
                 fluorescence images to measure FRET efficiency, the
                 relative concentrations of donor and acceptor, and the
                 fractions of donor and acceptor in complex in living
                 cells. FRET stoichiometry derives from the concept that
                 specific donor-acceptor complexes will give rise to a
                 characteristic FRET efficiency, which, if measured, can
                 allow stoichiometric discrimination of interacting
                 components. A first equation determines FRET efficiency
                 and the fraction of acceptor molecules in complex with
                 donor. A second equation determines the fraction of
                 donor molecules in complex by estimating the donor
                 fluorescence lost due to energy transfer. This
                 eliminates the need for acceptor photobleaching to
                 determine total donor concentrations and allows for
                 repeated measurements from the same cell. A third
                 equation obtains the ratio of total acceptor to total
                 donor molecules. The theory and method were confirmed
                 by microscopic measurements of fluorescence from cyan
                 fluorescent protein (CFP), citrine, and linked
                 CFP-Citrine fusion protein, in solutions and inside
                 cells. Together, the methods derived from these
                 equations allow sensitive, rapid, and repeatable
                 detection of donor-, acceptor-, and donor-acceptor
                 complex stoichiometry at each pixel in an image. By
                 accurately imaging molecular interactions, FRET
                 stoichiometry opens new areas for quantitative study of

  abstract =     "Mitochondria act as potent buffers of intracellular
                 Ca2+ in many cells, but a more active role in
                 modulating the generation of Ca2+ signals is not well
                 established. We have investigated the ability of
                 mitochondria to modulate store-operated or capacitative
                 Ca2+ entry in Jurkat leukemic T cells and human T
                 lymphocytes using fluorescence imaging techniques.
                 Depletion of the ER Ca2+ store with thapsigargin (TG)
                 activates Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels
                 in T cells, and the ensuing influx of Ca2+ loads a
                 TG-insensitive intracellular store that by several
                 criteria appears to be mitochondria. Loading of this
                 store is prevented by carbonyl cyanide
                 m-chlorophenylhydrazone or by antimycin A1 +
                 oligomycin, agents that are known to inhibit
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ import by dissipating the
                 mitochondrial membrane potential. Conversely,
                 intracellular Na+ depletion, which inhibits
                 Na+-dependent Ca2+ export from mitochondria, enhances
                 store loading. In addition, we find that rhod-2 labels
                 mitochondria in T cells, and it reports changes in Ca2+
                 levels that are consistent with its localization in the
                 TG-insensitive store. Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondrial
                 store is sensitive (threshold is <400 nM cytosolic
                 Ca2+), rapid (detectable within 8 s), and does not
                 readily saturate. The rate of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake
                 is sensitive to extracellular [Ca2+], indicating that
                 mitochondria sense Ca2+ gradients near CRAC channels.
                 Remarkably, mitochondrial uncouplers or Na+ depletion
                 prevent the ability of T cells to maintain a high rate
                 of capacitative Ca2+ entry over prolonged periods of
                 >10 min. Under these conditions, the rate of Ca2+
                 influx in single cells undergoes abrupt transitions
                 from a high influx to a low influx state. These results
                 demonstrate that mitochondria not only buffer the Ca2+
                 that enters T cells via store-operated Ca2+ channels,
                 but also play an active role in modulating the rate of
                 capacitative Ca2+ entry.",

                 a highly conserved series of three protein kinases
                 implicated in diverse biological processes. Here we
                 demonstrate that the cascade arrangement has unexpected
                 consequences for the dynamics of MAPK signaling. We
                 solved the rate equations for the cascade numerically
                 and found that MAPK is predicted to behave like a
                 highly cooperative enzyme, even though it was not
                 assumed that any of the enzymes in the cascade were
                 regulated cooperatively. Measurements of MAPK
                 activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed this
                 prediction. The stimulus/response curve of the MAPK was
                 found to be as steep as that of a cooperative enzyme
                 with a Hill coefficient of 4-5, well in excess of that
                 of the classical allosteric protein hemoglobin. The
                 shape of the MAPK stimulus/ response curve may make the
                 cascade particularly appropriate for mediating
                 processes like mitogenesis, cell fate induction, and
                 oocyte maturation, where a cell switches from one
                 discrete state to another.",

                 infrastructure which is effective, easy to implement
                 and easy to understand. SBW uses a broker-based

                 pore, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore
                 (MTP), is known to occur under conditions of oxidative
                 stress and matrix calcium overload. MTP opening and the
                 resulting cellular energy deprivation have been
                 implicated in processes such as hypoxic cell damage,
                 apoptosis, and neuronal excitotoxicity. Membrane
                 potential (delta psi(m)) in single isolated heart
                 mitochondria was measured by confocal microscopy with a
                 voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye. Measurements in
                 mitochondrial populations revealed a gradual loss of
                 delta psi(m) due to the light-induced generation of
                 free radicals. In contrast, the depolarization in
                 individual mitochondria was fast, sometimes causing
                 marked oscillations of delta psi(m). Rapid
                 depolarizations were accompanied by an increased
                 permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to
                 matrix-entrapped calcein (approximately 620 Da),
                 indicating the opening of a large membrane pore. The
                 MTP inhibitor cyclosporin A significantly stabilized
                 delta psi(m) in single mitochondria, thereby slowing
                 the voltage decay in averaged recordings. We conclude
                 that the spontaneous depolarizations were caused by
                 repeated stochastic openings and closings of the
                 transition pore. The data demonstrate a much more
                 dynamic regulation of membrane permeability at the
                 level of a single organelle than predicted from
                 ensemble behavior of mitochondrial populations.",

                 Recordings averaged over small mitochondrial

                 caused by the light-induced generation of free

                 dithiothreitol or acidification. In contrast,
                 individual organelles displayed rapid spontaneous
                 depolarizations caused by openings of the mitochondrial
                 permeability transition pore (MTP). Repetitive openings
                 and closings of the pore gave rise to marked
                 fluctuations in DeltaPsi(m) between the fully charged

                 fluctuations in DeltaPsi(m) were observed in
                 mitochondria isolated from rat heart and in
                 mitochondria in living endothelial cells. The loss of
                 DeltaPsi(m) of mitochondria in the living cell
                 coincided with swelling of the organelle and the
                 breakdown of long mitochondrial filaments. In the
                 individual mitochondrion, oxidative stress initially
                 triggered pore openings of shorter duration, before
                 prolonged openings caused the complete dissipation of
                 DeltaPsi(m) and a measurable efflux of larger solutes.
                 Generalizing this scheme, we suggest that under
                 conditions of prolonged oxidative stress and/or
                 cellular Ca(2+) overload, short openings of MTP might
                 serve as an emergency mechanism allowing the partial
                 dissipation of DeltaPsi(m), the fast release of
                 accumulated Ca(2+) ions and the decreased generation of
                 endogenous oxygen radicals. In contrast, loss of matrix
                 metabolites, swelling and other structural damage of
                 the organelle render prolonged openings of the

                 ectopically expressing the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin to
                 study integrin affinity and cytoskeletal interactions
                 during cell migration. The alpha IIb beta 3 integrins
                 are suited for study of integrin receptors during cell
                 migration because they are well characterized with
                 respect to ligand binding, cytoskeletal interactions,
                 and signal transduction, and mutants with altered
                 receptor function are available. The alpha IIb beta 3
                 receptor specifically mediates migration of alpha IIb
                 beta 3-transfected CHO cells. The migration of
                 transfected CHO cells was studied on a fibrinogen
                 substrate both by time lapse videomicroscopy and by
                 random and haptotactic transwell assays. Haptotactic
                 and random transwell assays measured distinct aspects
                 of migration, with the random transwell assay
                 correlating most closely with time lapse
                 videomicroscopy. Mutations in the cytoplasmic domains
                 that increase ligand affinity or activation of the
                 alpha IIb beta 3 receptor into a high affinity state by
                 the LIBS6 antibody decreased the migration rate.
                 Likewise, mutations that increase cytoskeletal
                 organization without affecting affinity also decreased
                 the migration rate. In contrast, truncation of the beta
                 chain, which alters cytoskeletal associations as
                 assayed by absence of focal adhesions, decreased
                 haptotactic migration while increasing random
                 migration. These effects on the migration rate were
                 partially compensated for by altering substrate
                 concentration, demonstrating optimum substrate
                 concentrations that supported maximal migration. For
                 example, cells expressing integrins locked in the high
                 affinity state showed maximal migration at lower
                 substrate concentrations than cells expressing low
                 affinity receptor. Together, these results implicate
                 the strength of adhesion between cell and substrate, as
                 modulated by receptor affinity, organization of
                 adhesive complexes, and substrate concentration, as
                 important regulators of cell migration rate. Further,
                 we demonstrate a dominant effect of high affinity
                 integrin in inhibiting migration regardless of the
                 organization of adhesive complexes. These observations
                 have potential implications for tumor metastasis and

                 apoptotic cascade during Ca2+-dependent cell death.
                 Correspondingly, two open conformations of the PTP can
                 also be observed in isolated organelles. A
                 low-conductance state, that allows the diffusion of
                 small ions like Ca2+, is pH-operated, promoting
                 spontaneous closure of the channel. A high-conductance
                 state, that allows the unselective diffusion of big
                 molecules, stabilizes the channel in the open
                 conformation, disrupting in turn the mitochondrial
                 structure and causing the release of proapoptotic
                 factors. Our current results indicate that switching
                 from low- to high-conductance state is an irreversible
                 process that is strictly dependent on the saturation of
                 the internal Ca2+-binding sites of the PTP. Thus, the
                 high-conductance state of the PTP, which was shown to
                 play a pivotal role in the course of excitotoxic and
                 thapsigargin-induced cell death, might result from a
                 Ca2+-dependent conformational shift of the
                 low-conductance state, normally participating in the
                 regulation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis as a
                 pH-operated channel. These observations lead us to
                 propose a simple biophysical model of the transition
                 between Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+-dependent apoptosis.",

                 Cl- -secretory colonic epithelial cells (HT-29/B6).
                 Digital imaging of the fluorescent calcium indicator
                 dye fura-2 was performed to monitor effects of K+
                 channel blockers on cytosolic calcium in resting and
                 carbachol-stimulated HT-29/B6 cells. Stimulation with
                 the muscarinic agonist carbachol (100 .mu.M) caused a
                 clearly biphasic intracellular calcium (Cai) response:
                 Cai was stimulated from resting levels (85.+-. 3 nM, n
                 = 100) to a sudden transient peak (821.+-. 44 nM)
                 followed by a sustained plateau (317.+-. 12 nM). The
                 maintained elevation was developed on external Ca2+ and
                 represented a new steady state between Ca2+ entry and
                 exit across the plasma membrane. A monophasic Ca2+
                 response was induced in the absence of external Ca2+
                 and after the initial peak Cai returned to baseline.
                 The Cai plateau was reduced to resting levels by either
                 the muscarinic antagonist atropine (1 .mu.M) or the
                 inorganic Ca2+ channel blocker lanthanum (effective
                 concentration for 50\% inhibition of Cai plateau EC50 =
                 68 .+-. 18 nM), but it was unaffected by the organic
                 Ca2+ channel blockers verapamil and nifedipine. Barium,
                 lidocaine and 4-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoate
                 (NPPB), well-known blockers of basolateral K+ channels
                 of HT-29/B6 cells, rapidly and reversibly reduced
                 carbachol-stimulated Ca2+ entry. The Cai plateau was
                 calculated to be 50\% inhibited by barium (96.+-. 2
                 .mu.M), lidocaine (74.+-. 3 .mu.M) and NPPB (27.+-. 10
                 .mu.M). The Cai plateau was transiently increased by 1
                 .mu.M and 10 .mu.M NPPB to 50\% and 34\%, respectively,
                 probably via hyperpolarization of the membrane
                 potential by blockade of Cl- channels (so that the
                 membrane potential approached VK). The resting Cai was
                 transiently increased by 50 .mu.M and 300 .mu.M NPPB to
                 308.+-. 13 nM and 447.+-. 153 nM, respectively,
                 suggesting that NPPB induced a Ca2+ release from
                 internal Ca stores. We conclude that
                 carbachol-stimulated Ca2+ entry into HT-29/B6 cells (a)
                 requires muscarinic receptor occupation, (b) is highly
                 sensitive to lanthanum and (c) is dependent on membrane
                 potential and therefore inhibited by channel blockers
                 that depolarize the cell potential. Also, the
                 sensitivity of Cai levels to K+ channel blockers
                 indicates that there are feedback relationships among
                 rates of Ca2+ entry, activity of Ca2+-activated K+ and
                 Cl-channels and membrane potential",

                 cerebellar slices. PCs in SCA1 mice had Na(+) spikes,
                 Ca(2+) spikes, climbing fiber (CF) electrical
                 responses, parallel fiber (PF) electrical responses,
                 and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated,
                 PF-evoked Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores that
                 were qualitatively similar to those recorded from WT
                 mice. Under our experimental conditions, it was easier
                 to evoke the mGluR-mediated secondary [Ca(2+)](i)
                 increase in SCA1 PCs. The membrane resistance of SCA1
                 PCs was 3.3 times higher than that of WT cells, which
                 correlated with the 1.7 times smaller cell body size.
                 Most SCA1 PCs (but not WT) had a delayed onset (about
                 50--200 ms) to Na(+) spike firing induced by current
                 injection. This delay was increased by hyperpolarizing
                 prepulses and was eliminated by 4-aminopyridine, which
                 suggests that this delay was due to enhancement of the
                 A-like K(+) conductance in the SCA1 PCs. In response to
                 CF stimulation, most PCs in mutant and WT mice had
                 rapid, widespread [Ca(2+)](i) changes that recovered in
                 <200 ms. Some SCA1 PCs showed a slow, localized,
                 secondary Ca(2+) transient following the initial CF
                 Ca(2+) transient, which may reflect release of Ca(2+)
                 from intracellular stores. Thus, with these exceptions,
                 the basic physiological properties of mutant PCs are
                 similar to those of WT neurons, even with dramatic
                 alteration of their morphology and downregulation of
                 Ca(2+) handling molecules.",

                 in voltage-dependent Na(+) and K(+) channels is in
                 contact with a solvent-accessible cavity. We explore
                 the consequences of the existence of such a cavity
                 through the electrostatic effects on the gating
                 currents of Shaker K(+) channels under conditions of
                 reduced ionic strength S. We observe that approximately
                 10-fold reductions of intracellular S produce
                 reductions of the measured gating charge of
                 approximately 10\%. These effects continue at even
                 lower values of S. The reduction of gating charge when
                 S is reduced by 10-fold at the extracellular surface is
                 much smaller (approximately 2\%). Shifts of the Q(V)
                 curve because of a reduced S are small (<10 mV in
                 size), which is consistent with very little fixed
                 surface charge. Continuum electrostatic calculations
                 show that the S effects on gating charge can be
                 explained by the alteration of the local potential in
                 an intracellular conical cavity of 20-24-A depth and
                 12-A aperture, and a smaller extracellular cavity of
                 3-A depth and the same aperture. In this case, the
                 attenuation of the membrane potential at low S leads to
                 reduction of the apparent gating charge. We suggest
                 that this cavity is made by a bundle of transmembrane
                 helices, and that the gating charge movement occurs by
                 translocation of charged residues across a thin septum
                 of approximately 3-7 A thickness.",

                 synaptic plasticity, namely, long-term depression
                 (LTD). When two inputs to a Purkinje cell, one from a
                 climbing fiber and the other from a set of granule cell
                 axons, are repeatedly associated, the input efficacy of
                 the granule cell axons in exciting the Purkinje cell is
                 persistently depressed. Section I of this review
                 briefly describes the history of research around LTD,
                 and section II specifies physiological characteristics
                 of LTD. Sections III and IV then review the massive
                 data accumulated during the past two decades, which
                 have revealed complex networks of signal transduction
                 underlying LTD. Section III deals with a variety of
                 first messengers, receptors, ion channels,
                 transporters, G proteins, and phospholipases. Section
                 IV covers second messengers, protein kinases,
                 phosphatases and other elements, eventually leading to
                 inactivation of
                 DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolone-propionate-selective
                 glutamate receptors that mediate granule
                 cell-to-Purkinje cell transmission. Section V defines
                 roles of LTD in the light of the microcomplex concept
                 of the cerebellum as functionally eliminating those
                 synaptic connections associated with errors during
                 repeated exercises, while preserving other connections
                 leading to the successful execution of movements.
                 Section VI examines the validity of this microcomplex
                 concept based on the data collected from recent
                 numerous studies of various forms of motor learning in
                 ocular reflexes, eye-blink conditioning, posture,
                 locomotion, and hand/arm movements. Section VII
                 emphasizes the importance of integrating studies on LTD
                 and learning and raises future possibilities of
                 extending cerebellar research to reveal memory
                 mechanisms of implicit learning in general.",

                 structural elements of cellular membranes, and analysis
                 of changes in the highly heterogeneous mixtures of
                 lipids found in eukaryotic cells is central to
                 understanding the complex functions in which lipids
                 participate. Phospholipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of
                 phospholipids often follows cell surface receptor
                 activation. Recently, we demonstrated that granule
                 fusion is initiated by addition of exogenous,
                 nonmammalian phospholipases to permeabilized mast
                 cells. To pursue this finding, we use positive and
                 negative mode Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance
                 mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) to measure changes in the
                 glycerophospholipid composition of total lipid extracts
                 of intact and permeabilized RBL-2H3 (mucosal mast cell
                 line) cells. The low energy of the electrospray
                 ionization results in efficient production of molecular
                 ions of phospholipids uncomplicated by further
                 fragmentation, and changes were observed that eluded
                 conventional detection methods. From these analyses we
                 have spectrally resolved more than 130
                 glycerophospholipids and determined changes initiated
                 by introduction of exogenous phospholipase C,
                 phospholipase D, or phospholipase A2. These exogenous
                 phospholipases have a preference for
                 phosphatidylcholine with long polyunsaturated alkyl
                 chains as substrates and, when added to permeabilized
                 mast cells, produce multiple species of mono- and
                 polyunsaturated diacylglycerols, phosphatidic acids,
                 and lysophosphatidylcholines, respectively. The
                 patterns of changes of these lipids provide an

  abstract =     "We present a model that provides a unified framework
                 for studying Ca2+ sparks and Ca2+ waves in cardiac
                 cells. The model is novel in combining 1) use of large
                 currents (~20 pA) through the Ca2+ release units (CRUs)
                 of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); 2) stochastic Ca2+
                 release (or firing) of CRUs; 3) discrete, asymmetric
                 distribution of CRUs along the longitudinal (separation
                 distance of 2 m) and transverse (separated by 0.4-0.8
                 m) directions of the cell; and 4) anisotropic diffusion
                 of Ca2+ and fluorescent indicator to study the
                 evolution of Ca2+ waves from Ca2+ sparks. The model
                 mimics the important features of Ca2+ sparks and Ca2+
                 waves in terms of the spontaneous spark rate, the Ca2+
                 wave velocity, and the pattern of wave propagation.
                 Importantly, these features are reproduced when using
                 experimentally measured values for the CRU Ca2+
                 sensitivity (~15 M). Stochastic control of CRU firing
                 is important because it imposes constraints on the Ca2+
                 sensitivity of the CRU. Even with moderate (~5 M) Ca2+
                 sensitivity the very high spontaneous spark rate
                 triggers numerous Ca2+ waves. In contrast, a single
                 Ca2+ wave with arbitrarily large velocity can exist in
                 a deterministic model when the CRU Ca2+ sensitivity is
                 sufficiently high. The combination of low CRU Ca2+
                 sensitivity (~15 M), high cytosolic Ca2+ buffering
                 capacity, and the spatial separation of CRUs help
                 control the inherent instability of SR Ca2+ release.
                 This allows Ca2+ waves to form and propagate given a
                 sufficiently large initiation region, but prevents a
                 single spark or a small group of sparks from triggering
                 a wave.",

  abstract =     "Previous models of cardiac Ca2+ sparks have assumed
                 that Ca2+ currents through the Ca2+ release units
                 (CRUs) were ~1-2 pA, producing sparks with peak
                 fluorescence ratio (F/F0) of ~2.0 and a full-width at
                 half maximum (FWHM) of ~1 m. Here, we present actual
                 Ca2+ sparks with peak F/F0 of >6 and a FWHM of ~2 m,
                 and a mathematical model of such sparks, the main
                 feature of which is a much larger underlying Ca2+
                 current. Assuming infinite reaction rates and no
                 endogenous buffers, we obtain a lower bound of ~11 pA
                 needed to generate a Ca2+ spark with FWHM of 2 m. Under
                 realistic conditions, the CRU current must be ~20 pA to
                 generate a 2-m Ca2+ spark. For currents[&gt;=] 5 pA,
                 the computed spark amplitudes (F/F0) are large (~6-12
                 depending on buffer model). We considered several
                 factors that might produce sparks with FWHM ~ 2 m
                 without using large currents. Possible protein-dye
                 interactions increased the FWHM slightly. Hypothetical
                 Ca2+ quarks had little effect, as did blurring of
                 sparks by the confocal microscope. A clusters of CRUs,
                 each producing 10 pA simultaneously, can produce sparks
                 with FWHM ~ 2 m. We conclude that cardiac Ca2+ sparks
                 are significantly larger in peak amplitude than
                 previously thought, that such large Ca2+ sparks are
                 consistent with the measured FWHM of ~2 m, and that the
                 underlying Ca2+ current is in the range of 10-20 pA.",

  abstract =     "A difficulty of using confocal microscopy to study
                 Ca2+ sparks is the uncertainty of the linescan position
                 with respect to the source of Ca2+ release. Random
                 placement of the linescan is expected to result in a
                 broad distribution of measured Ca2+ spark amplitudes
                 (a) even if all Ca2+ sparks were generated identically.
                 Thus variations in Ca2+ spark amplitude due to
                 positional differences between confocal linescans and
                 Ca2+ release site are intertwined with variations due
                 to intrinsic differences in Ca2+ release properties. To
                 separate these two sources of variations on the Ca2+
                 spark amplitude, we determined the effect changes of
                 channel current or channel open time--collectively
                 called the source strength, alpha--had on the measured
                 Ca2+ spark amplitude histogram, N(a). This was done by
                 1) simulating Ca2+ release, Ca2+ and fluo-3 diffusion,
                 and Ca2+ binding reactions; 2) simulation of image
                 formation of the Ca2+ spark by a confocal microscope;
                 and 3) using a novel automatic Ca2+ spark detector.
                 From these results we derived an integral equation
                 relating the probability density function of source
                 strengths, f alpha (alpha), to N(a), which takes into
                 account random positional variations between the source
                 and linescan. In the special, but important, case that
                 the spatial distribution of Ca(2+)-bound fluo-3 is
                 Gaussian, we show the following: 1) variations of Ca2+
                 spark amplitude due to positional or intrinsic
                 differences can be separated, and 2) f alpha (alpha)
                 can, in principle, be calculated from the Ca2+ spark
                 amplitude histogram since N(a) is the sum of shifted
                 hyperbolas, where the magnitudes of the shifts and
                 weights depend on f alpha (alpha). In particular, if
                 all Ca2+ sparks were generated identically, then the
                 plot of 1/N(a) against a will be a straight line.
                 Multiple populations of channels carrying distinct
                 currents are revealed by discontinuities in the 1/N(a)
                 plot. 3) Although the inverse relationship between Ca2+
                 spark amplitude and decay time might be used to
                 distinguish Ca2+ sparks from different channel
                 populations, noise can render the measured decay times
                 meaningless for small amplitude Ca2+ sparks.",

                 ryanodine-sensitive sarcoplasmic reticulum has remained
                 elusive. IP(3) generated by photolysis of caged IP(3)
                 or by purinergic activation of phospholipase Cgamma
                 slowed down or abolished autonomic Ca(2+) spiking in
                 neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Microinjection of heparin,
                 blocking dominant-negative fusion protein, or
                 anti-phospholipase Cgamma antibody prevented the
                 IP(3)-mediated purinergic effect. IP(3) triggered a
                 ryanodine- and caffeine-insensitive Ca(2+) release
                 restricted to the perinuclear region. In cells loaded
                 with Rhod2 or expressing a mitochondria-targeted
                 cameleon and TMRM to monitor mitochondrial Ca(2+) and
                 potential, IP(3) induced transient Ca(2+) loading and
                 depolarization of the organelles. These mitochondrial
                 changes were associated with Ca(2+) depletion of the
                 sarcoplasmic reticulum and preceded the arrest of
                 cellular Ca(2+) spiking. Thus, IP(3) acting within a
                 restricted cellular region regulates the dynamic of
                 calcium flow between mitochondria and the
                 endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum. We have thus

                 concentration are important signaling events for
                 transcriptional regulation and neuronal plasticity.
                 Electrical inputs are thought to mediate Ca2+ responses
                 in the soma by triggering action potentials, which in
                 turn open voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the somatic
                 plasma membrane. It is not yet known to what extent
                 internal Ca2+ amplification contributes to the somatic
                 Ca2+ responses. Here we used fluorescent Ca2+
                 measurements in cultured hippocampal neurons and report
                 that the amplitude of the somatic Ca2+ increase
                 triggered by field stimulation is independent of the
                 extracellular Ca2+ concentration as long as the
                 concentration is greater than 50 microM. Furthermore,
                 significantly more La3+ has to be added extracellularly
                 for blocking Ca2+ responses, as predicted from the
                 reported La3+ dependence of voltage-gated Ca2+
                 channels. These measurements suggest that field
                 stimulation-induced somatic Ca2+ responses in
                 hippocampal neurons are largely attributable to Ca2+
                 release from intracellular stores. Only a small number
                 of Ca2+ ions have to enter across the plasma membrane
                 for this intracellular Ca2+ amplification process to
                 occur. Rapid fluorescence-imaging measurements showed
                 that the internal Ca2+ amplification occurs over 10-15
                 msec and linearly increases intracellular Ca2+
                 concentrations for up to 40 action potentials. At a
                 fixed number of field pulses, frequencies of 40 Hz were
                 optimal for somatic Ca2+ increases. Our studies suggest
                 that the opening of intracellular Ca2+ release channels
                 plays a crucial part in shaping the action
                 potential-induced neuronal Ca2+ response.",

                 stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in response to
                 the second messenger inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate
                 (InsP3) [1,2]. Then, a poorly understood cellular
                 mechanism, termed capacitative Ca2+ entry, is activated
                 [3,4]; this permits Ca2+ to enter cells through
                 Ca(2+)-selective Ca(2+)-release-activated ion channels
                 [5,6] as well as through less selective store-operated
                 channels [7]. The level of stored Ca2+ is sensed by
                 Ca(2+)-permeant channels in the plasma membrane, but
                 the identity of these channels, and the link between
                 them and Ca2+ stores, remain unknown. It has been
                 argued that either a diffusible second messenger (Ca2+
                 influx factor; CIF) [8] or a physical link [9,10]
                 connects the ER Ca(2+)-release channel and
                 store-operated channels; strong evidence for either
                 mechanism is lacking, however [7,10]. Petersen and
                 Berridge [11] showed that activation of the
                 lysophosphatidic acid receptor in a restricted region
                 of the oocyte membrane results in stimulation of Ca2+
                 influx only in that region, and concluded that a
                 diffusible messenger was unlikely. To investigate the
                 relationship between ER stores and Ca2+ influx, we used
                 centrifugation to redistribute into specific layers the
                 organelles inside intact Xenopus laevis oocytes, and
                 used laser scanning confocal microscopy with the
                 two-photon technique to 'uncage' InsP3 while recording
                 intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Ca2+ release was
                 localized to the stratified ER layer and Ca2+ entry to
                 regions of the membrane directly adjacent to this
                 layer. We conclude that Ca2+ depletion and entry
                 colocalize to the ER and that the mechanism linking
                 Ca2+ stores to Ca2+ entry is similarly locally

                 fluorescent protein (drFP583 or DsRed), isolated from

                 maxima at 509 and 583 nm respectively, EGFP and DsRed
                 are suited for almost crossover free dual color

                 or DsRed by one-photon confocal and by two-photon
                 microscopy. Both excitation modes proved to be suitable
                 for imaging cells expressing either of the fluorescent
                 proteins. DsRed had an extended maturation time and E.
                 coli expressing this fluorescent protein were
                 significantly smaller than those expressing EGFP. In

                 (orthogonal to pia) orientation, constraining the

                 for the functional parcellation of the cortex into
                 semi-independent vertical columns or 'modules'. Apical
                 dendrites of excitatory pyramidal neurons are a major
                 component of this vertical neuropil, but the extent to
                 which inhibitory, GABAergic neurons conform to this
                 structural and functional design is less well
                 documented. We used a gene gun to transfect organotypic
                 slice cultures of mouse and rat neocortex with the
                 enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene driven
                 by the promoter for glutamic acid decarboxylase 67
                 (GAD67), an enzyme expressed exclusively in GABAergic
                 cells. Many GAD67-GFP expressing cells were highly
                 fluorescent, and their dendritic morphologies and
                 axonal patterns, revealed in minute detail, were
                 characteristic of GABAergic neurons. We traced 150
                 GFP-expressing neurons from confocal image stacks, and
                 estimated the degree of vertical bias in their
                 dendritic trees using a novel computational metric.
                 Over 70\% of the neurons in our sample had dendritic
                 trees with a highly significant vertical bias. We
                 conclude that GABAergic neurons make an important
                 contribution to the vertical neocortical neuropil, and
                 are likely to integrate synaptic inputs from axons
                 terminating within their own module.",

                 hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons control the shape and
                 amplitude of back-propagating action potentials, the
                 amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials and
                 dendritic excitability. Non-uniform gradients in the
                 distribution of potassium channels in the dendrites
                 make the dendritic electrical properties markedly
                 different from those found in the soma. For example,
                 the influence of a fast, calcium-dependent potassium
                 current on action potential repolarization is
                 progressively reduced in the first 150 micrometer of
                 the apical dendrites, so that action potentials
                 recorded farther than 200 micrometer from the soma have
                 no fast after-hyperpolarization and are wider than
                 those in the soma. The peak amplitude of
                 back-propagating action potentials is also
                 progressively reduced in the dendrites because of the
                 increasing density of a transient potassium channel
                 with distance from the soma. The activation of this
                 channel can be reduced by the activity of a number of
                 protein kinases as well as by prior depolarization. The
                 depolarization from excitatory postsynaptic potentials
                 (EPSPs) can inactivate these A-type K+ channels and
                 thus lead to an increase in the amplitude of dendritic
                 action potentials, provided the EPSP and the action
                 potentials occur within the appropriate time window.
                 This time window could be in the order of 15 ms and may
                 play a role in long-term potentiation induced by
                 pairing EPSPs and back-propagating action potentials.",

                 and spatial patterns in neurons in which signal
                 initiation and repetitive spiking occurs predominantly
                 in the neurite. We investigated the functional
                 implications of the coexpression of different isoforms
                 of ryanodine receptors (RyR) and inositol
                 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) using
                 immunocytochemistry, Western blotting, and calcium
                 imaging in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells. InsP3R
                 type III, an isoform that has been shown to be
                 upregulated in neuronal apoptosis, is exclusively
                 expressed in the soma, serving as a gatekeeper for
                 high-magnitude calcium surges. InsP3R type I is
                 expressed throughout the cell and can be related to
                 signal initiation and repetitive spiking in the
                 neurite. RyR types 2 and 3 are distributed throughout
                 the cell. In the soma, they serve as amplifying
                 molecular switches, facilitating recruitment of the
                 InsP3R type III-dependent pool. In the neurite, they
                 decrease the probability of repetitive spiking. Use of
                 a cell-permeant analog of InsP3 suggested that regional
                 specificity in InsP3 production and surface-to-volume
                 effects play minor roles in determining temporal and
                 spatial calcium signaling patterns in neurons. Our
                 findings suggest that additional modulatory processes
                 acting on the intracellular channels are necessary to
                 generate spatially specific calcium signaling.",

                 Ca2+ release is an excitable process that generates
                 propagating Ca2+ waves that annihilate upon collision.
                 The fundamental property responsible for excitability
                 appears to be the Ca2+ dependency of the Ins(1,4,5)P3
                 receptor. Here we report that Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+

                 cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) oscillations that

                 Calcium Green-1 and rhod-2 as optical measures of
                 cytoplasmic and mitochondrial free Ca(2+), we show that
                 mitochondria sequester Ca(2+) and tune the frequency of
                 [Ca(2+)](cyt) oscillations in rat gonadotropes.
                 Mitochondria accumulated Ca(2+) rapidly and in phase
                 with elevations of [Ca(2+)](cyt) after GnRH stimulation
                 or membrane depolarization. Inhibiting mitochondrial
                 Ca(2+) uptake by the protonophore CCCP reduced the
                 frequency of GnRH-induced [Ca(2+)](cyt) oscillations
                 or, occasionally, stopped them. Much of the Ca(2+) that
                 entered mitochondria is bound by intramitochondrial
                 Ca(2+) buffering systems. The mitochondrial Ca(2+)
                 binding ratio may be dynamic because [Ca(2+)](mit)
                 appeared to reach a plateau as mitochondrial Ca(2+)
                 accumulation continued. Entry of Ca(2+) into
                 mitochondria was associated with a small drop in the
                 mitochondrial membrane potential. Ca(2+) was extruded
                 from mitochondria more slowly than it entered, and much
                 of this efflux could be blocked by CGP-37157, a
                 selective inhibitor of mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca(2+)
                 exchange. Plasma membrane capacitance changes in
                 response to depolarizing voltage trains were increased
                 when CCCP was added, showing that mitochondria lower
                 the local [Ca(2+)](cyt) near sites that trigger
                 exocytosis. Thus, we demonstrate a central role for

                 slices by using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
                 combined with fluorometric digital imaging of
                 cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). 2. Caffeine
                 caused a transient increase in [Ca2+]i in the somata
                 and dendrites of Purkinje neurones. Caffeine-induced
                 Ca2+ transients were not associated with a membrane
                 inward current and persisted in Ca(2+)-free external
                 solutions, indicating that they are caused by Ca2+
                 released from intracellular stores. The amplitudes of
                 the caffeine-mediated elevations in [Ca2+]i were
                 strongly dependent on the baseline level of [Ca2+]i. 3.
                 Intracellular application of Ruthenium Red through the
                 patch pipette blocked caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients
                 in Purkinje neurones. Ryanodine when applied either
                 intra- or extracellularly caused a use-dependent block
                 of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release. 4.
                 Depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients were strongly
                 prolonged by caffeine. Several lines of evidence
                 suggest that these prolongations reflect Ca(2+)-induced
                 Ca2+ release. 5. Despite the presence of skeletal
                 muscle type ryanodine receptors in Purkinje neurones,
                 depolarizing pulses failed to induce any changes in
                 [Ca2+]i when the influx of Ca2+ through voltage-gated
                 channels was prevented by using Ca(2+)-free solution,
                 or when applying blockers of voltage-gated Ca2+
                 channels. 6. Dendritic Ca2+ transients produced by
                 stimulation of the excitatory climbing fibre synaptic
                 input were also prolonged by caffeine, indicating that
                 ryanodine receptor-mediated release of Ca2+ may be
                 involved in synaptic signalling in cerebellar Purkinje
                 neurones. 7. Ryanodine receptor-mediated release of
                 Ca2+ in cerebellar Purkinje neurones can be explained
                 by a model in which release of Ca2+ is strongly
                 facilitated by the co-operative action of Ca2+,
                 caffeine and/or ryanodine. Our results suggest that
                 Ca2+ release in these central neurones becomes
                 prominent only during episodes of intensive electrical
                 activity associated with increased Ca2+ entry.",

  abstract =     "Previous measurements of transmembrane potential using
                 the electrochromic probe di-8-ANEPPS have used the
                 excitation spectral shift response by alternating
                 excitation between two wavelengths centered at
                 voltage-sensitive portions of the excitation spectrum
                 and recording at a single wavelength near the peak of
                 the emission spectrum. Recently, the emission spectral
                 shift associated with the change in transmembrane
                 potential has been used for continuous membrane
                 potential monitoring. To characterize this form of the
                 electrochromic response from di-8-ANEPPS, we have
                 obtained fluorescence signals from single cells in
                 response to step changes in transmembrane potentials
                 set with a patch electrode, using single wavelength
                 excitation near the peak of the dye absorption
                 spectrum. Fluorescence changes at two wavelengths near
                 voltage-sensitive portions of the emission spectrum and
                 shifts in the complete emission spectrum were
                 determined for emission from plasma membrane and
                 internal membrane. We found that the fluorescence ratio
                 from either dual-wavelength recordings, or from
                 opposite sides of the emission spectrum, varied
                 linearly with the amplitude of the transmembrane
                 potential step between -80 and +60 mV. Voltage
                 dependence of difference spectra exhibit a crossover
                 point near the peak of the emission spectra with
                 approximately equal gain and loss of fluorescence
                 intensity on each side of the spectrum and equal
                 response amplitude for depolarization and
                 hyperpolarization. These results are consistent with an
                 electrochromic mechanism of action and demonstrate how
                 the emission spectral shift response can be used to
                 measure the transmembrane potential in single cells.",

                 versions of the Staphylococcus aureus alpha-hemolysin
                 (alphaHL) ion channel to serve as rationally designed
                 sensor components for analytes including divalent

                 activity nor the single channel current of wild-type
                 alphaHL was affected by [Zn(II)] </= 1 mM. Binding
                 sites for the divalent cations were formed by altering
                 the number and location of coordinating side chains,
                 e.g., histidines and aspartic acids, between positions
                 126 and 134, inclusive. Several mutant alphaHLs
                 exhibited Zn(II)-induced current noise that varied with
                 Zn(II) concentration. At a fixed divalent cation
                 concentration, the current fluctuation kinetics
                 depended on the analyte type, e.g., Zn(II), Cu(II),
                 Ni(II), and Co(II). We also show that the ability of
                 Zn(II) to change the mutant channel current suggests
                 that the pore's topology is beta-sheet and that
                 position 130 is near the turn at the trans mouth. Both
                 conclusions are consistent with the crystal structure
                 of WT-alphaHL oligomerized in detergent. Our results,
                 in the context of the channel's crystal structure,
                 suggest that conductance blockades were caused by
                 Zn(II) binding to the outside surface of the pore.
                 Thus, analyte-induced current blockades alone might not
                 establish whether an analyte binding site is inside a
                 pore.",

                 cellular Ca2+ overload. As mitochondrial depolarisation
                 may represent a pivotal step in the progression to cell
                 death, we have used digital imaging techniques to
                 examine the relationship between cytosolic Ca2+
                 concentration ([Ca2+]c) and mitochondrial potential
                 (DeltaPsim) during glutamate toxicity, and to define
                 the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction. 2.
                 In cells of > 11 days in vitro (DIV), exposure to 50 mM
                 potassium or 100 microM glutamate had different
                 consequences for DeltaPsim. KCl caused a small
                 transient loss of DeltaPsim but in response to
                 glutamate there was a profound loss of DeltaPsim. In
                 cells of 7-10 DIV, glutamate caused only a modest and
                 reversible drop in DeltaPsim. 3. Using fura-2 to
                 measure [Ca2+]c, responses to KCl and glutamate did not
                 appear significantly different. However, use of the low
                 affinity indicator fura-2FF revealed a difference in
                 the [Ca2+]c responses to KCl and glutamate, which
                 clearly correlated with the loss of DeltaPsim. Neurons
                 exhibiting a profound mitochondrial depolarisation also
                 showed a large secondary increase in the fura-2FF
                 ratio. 4. The glutamate-induced loss of DeltaPsim was
                 dependent on Ca2+ influx. However, inhibition of nitric
                 oxide synthase (NOS) by L-NAME significantly attenuated
                 the loss of DeltaPsim. Furthermore, photolysis of caged
                 NO at levels that had no effect alone promoted a
                 profound mitochondrial depolarisation when combined
                 with high [Ca2+]c, either in response to KCl or to
                 glutamate in cultures at 7-10 DIV. 5. In cells that
                 showed only modest mitochondrial responses to
                 glutamate, induction of a mitochondrial depolarisation
                 by the addition of NO was followed by a secondary rise
                 in [Ca2+]c. These data suggest that [Ca2+]c and nitric
                 oxide act synergistically to cause mitochondrial
                 dysfunction and impaired [Ca2+]c homeostasis during
                 glutamate toxicity.",

                 is analyzed by taking into account the unavoidable
                 interplay between chromatic and spherical aberration
                 simultaneously for the first time. The spatial
                 intensity distribution is mainly affected by spherical
                 aberration, whereas the temporal distribution is
                 determined by both aberrations. The impact on
                 second-harmonic generation for femtosecond pulse
                 measurements is discussed. For example, the presence of
                 spherical aberration allows one to record the correct
                 autocorrelation of a 10-fs pulse even if chromatic
                 aberration alone would cause a half-width of the
                 autocorrelation function of 40 fs.",

                 focusing femtosecond light pulses by single lenses is
                 presented. By evaluation of the diffraction integral
                 the interplay of spherical and chromatic aberration is
                 shown to determine the temporal as well as the spatial
                 intensity distribution in the focal region of a lens.
                 Conditions are derived under which the effect of
                 spherical aberration dominates. Here a temporally
                 unbroadened, in-focus pulse occurs while the spatial
                 distribution is that expected from an annular lens
                 aperture. If chromatic aberration is the major
                 aberration, the in-focus pulses are considerably
                 broadened. Both effects could clearly be measured with
                 100-fs pulses using a modified Michelson
                 interferometer. In an intermediate parameter range both
                 chromatic and spherical aberration contribute to the
                 pulse broadening and to the spatial intensity pattern
                 in a given plane in the focal region. From Fresnel
                 diffraction we expect a weak-intensity distribution to
                 precede the in-focus pulse on the axis. Another weak
                 intensity peak is produced by the pulse traveling on
                 axis. By measuring its separation from the main pulse
                 in the marginal focal plane one can estimate the
                 aberration parameters.",

                 investigate the role of Ca2+ in mitochondrial function,
                 insulin secretion from INS-1 cells stably expressing
                 the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin in the
                 appropriate compartments was correlated with changes in
                 cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]c) and mitochondrial calcium
                 ([Ca2+]m). Glucose and KCl, which depolarize the cell
                 membrane, as well as the Ca2+-mobilizing agonist,
                 carbachol (CCh), cause substantial increases in [Ca2+]m
                 which are associated with smaller rises in [Ca2+]c. The
                 L-type Ca2+-channel blocker, SR7037, abolished the
                 effects of glucose and KCl while attenuating the CCh
                 response. Glucose-induced increases in [Ca2+]m,
                 [Ca2+]c, and insulin secretion all demonstrate a
                 pronounced initial peak followed by a sustained
                 plateau. All three parameters are increased
                 synergistically when glucose and CCh are combined.
                 Finally, [Ca2+]m, [Ca2+]c, and insulin secretion also
                 display desensitization phenomena following repeated
                 additions of the three stimuli. The high sensitivity of
                 [Ca2+]m to Ca2+ influx and the
                 desensitization-resensitization effects can be
                 explained by a model in which the mitochondria of INS-1
                 cells are strategically located to sense Ca2+ influx
                 through plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. In conclusion,
                 the correlation of [Ca2+]m and [Ca2+]c with insulin
                 secretion may indicate a fundamental role for Ca2+ in
                 the adaptation of oxidative metabolism to the
                 generation of metabolic coupling factors and the energy

                 channels and activating Ca2+ influx. Here, we use
                 recombinant targeted luciferases and photon counting
                 imaging to monitor changes in free [ATP] in subdomains
                 of single living MIN6 and primary beta-cells. Resting
                 [ATP] in the cytosol ([ATP]c), in the mitochondrial
                 matrix ([ATP]m), and beneath the plasma membrane
                 ([ATP]pm) were similar ( approximately 1 mM).
                 Elevations in extracellular glucose concentration (3-30
                 mM) increased free [ATP] in each domain with distinct
                 kinetics. Thus, sustained increases in [ATP]m and
                 [ATP]pm were observed, but only a transient increase in
                 [ATP]c. However, detectable increases in [ATP]c and
                 [ATP]pm, but not [ATP]m, required extracellular Ca2+.
                 Enhancement of glucose-induced Ca2+ influx with high
                 [K+] had little effect on the apparent [ATP]c and
                 [ATP]m increases but augmented the [ATP]pm increase.
                 Underlying these changes, glucose increased the
                 mitochondrial proton motive force, an effect mimicked
                 by high [K+]. These data support a model in which
                 glucose increases [ATP]m both through enhanced
                 substrate supply and by progressive Ca2+-dependent
                 activation of mitochondrial enzymes. This may then lead
                 to a privileged elevation of [ATP]pm, which may be
                 essential for the sustained closure of KATP channels.
                 Luciferase imaging would appear to be a useful new tool
                 for dynamic in vivo imaging of free ATP

                 between glutamate (GLU)-induced mitochondrial
                 depolarization and deterioration of neuronal Ca2+
                 homeostasis following a prolonged GLU challenge. The
                 experiments were performed on cultured rat cerebellar
                 granule cells using the fluorescent probes, rhodamine
                 123 and fura-2. All the cells, in which 100 microM GLU
                 (10 microM glycine, 0 Mg2+) induced only relatively
                 slight mitochondrial depolarization (1.1-1.3-fold
                 increase in rhodamine 123 fluorescence), retained their
                 ability to recover [Ca2+]i following a prolonged GLU
                 challenge. In contrast, the cells in which GLU
                 treatment induced pronounced mitochondrial
                 depolarization (2-4-fold increase in rhodamine 123
                 fluorescence), exhibited a high Ca2+ plateau in the
                 post-glutamate period. Application of 3-5 mM NaCN or
                 0.25-1 microM FCCP during this Ca2+ plateau phase
                 usually failed to produce a further noticeable increase
                 in [Ca2+]i. Regression analysis revealed a good
                 correlation (r2 = 0.88 +/- 0.03, n = 19) between the
                 increase in the percentage of rhodamine 123
                 fluorescence and the post-glutamate [Ca2+]i.
                 Collectively, the results obtained led us to conclude
                 that the GLU-induced neuronal Ca2+ overload was due to
                 the collapse of the mitochondrial potential and
                 subsequent ATP depletion.",

  abstract =     "Cerebellar Purkinje neurons receive two major
                 excitatory inputs, the climbing fibers (CFs) and
                 parallel fibers (PFs). Simultaneous, repeated
                 activation of CFs and PFs results in the long-term
                 depression (LTD) of the amplitude of PF-evoked synaptic
                 currents. To induce LTD, activation of CFs may be
                 substituted with depolarization of the Purkinje neuron
                 to turn on voltage-activated calcium channels and
                 increase the intracellular calcium concentration. The
                 role of PFs in the induction of LTD, however, is less
                 clear. PFs activate glutamate metabotropic receptors
                 that increase phosphoinositide turnover and elevate
                 cytosolic inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). It has
                 been proposed that calcium release from intracellular
                 stores via InsP3 receptors may be important in the
                 induction of LTD. We studied the role of InsP3 in the
                 induction of LTD by photolytic release of InsP3 from
                 its biologically inactive caged precursor in
                 voltage-clamped Purkinje neurons in acutely prepared
                 cerebellar slices. We find that InsP3-evoked calcium
                 release is as effective in LTD induction as activation
                 of PFs. InsP3-induced LTD was prevented by calcium
                 chelator 1,2-bis(2-amino phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',
                 N'-tetraacetic acid. LTD produced either by repeated
                 activation of PFs combined with depolarization
                 (PF+DeltaV), or by InsP3 combined with depolarization
                 (InsP3+DeltaV) saturated at approximately 50\%. Maximal
                 LTD induced by PF+DeltaV could not be further increased
                 by InsP3+DeltaV and vice versa, which suggests that
                 both protocols for induction of LTD share a common
                 path. In addition to inducing LTD, photo-release of
                 InsP3+DeltaV resulted in the rebound potentiation of
                 inhibitory synaptic currents. In the presence of
                 heparin, an InsP3 receptor antagonist, repeated
                 activation of PF+DeltaV failed to induce LTD,
                 suggesting that InsP3 receptors play an important role
                 in LTD induction under physiological conditions.",

                 processes in excitable and nonexcitable cells. In
                 cerebellar Purkinje neurons, increases in [Ca2+]i
                 modulate excitability by turning on calcium-activated
                 potassium and chloride conductances, and modifying the
                 synaptic efficacy of inhibitory and excitatory inputs
                 to the cell. Calcium release from the intracellular
                 stores plays an important role in the regulation of
                 [Ca2+]i. Purkinje neurons contain both inositol
                 trisphosphate (InsP3) and ryanodine (Ry) receptors.
                 With the exception of the dendritic spines, where only
                 InsP3 receptors are found, InsP3 and Ry receptors are
                 present in the entire cell. The distribution of the two
                 calcium release channels, however, is not uniform, and
                 it has been suggested that InsP3 and Ry receptors use
                 separate Ca2+ pools. The functional properties of InsP3
                 and Ry Ca2+ pools were investigated by flash photolysis
                 and single-cell microspectrofluorimetry. It was found
                 that depletion of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores
                 renders InsP3 incapable of releasing more Ca2+ from the
                 stores. Abolishing calcium-induced calcium release by
                 blocking ryanodine receptors with ruthenium red did not
                 have a significant effect on InsP3-evoked Ca2+ release.
                 It is concluded that InsP3 receptors use the same
                 functional Ca2+ pool as that utilized by Ry receptors
                 in Purkinje neurons.",

                 electromagnetic field is derived under very general
                 conditions. it is shown that the motion is that of a

                 where µ2 is the parameter proportional to the field

                 is that of a particle with the effective
                 potential-energy function 1/2mc2µ2. The complete
                 analogy between processes of refraction of light by

                 trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor. However, it is unclear
                 how this might affect the Ca2+ response in vivo. 2.
                 Mouse pancreatic acinar cells were whole-cell patch
                 clamped to record the Ca2+-dependent chloride (Cl(Ca))
                 current spikes and imaged to record the cytosolic Ca2+
                 spikes elicited by the injection of Ins(2,4,5)P3.
                 Increasing concentrations of Ca2+ buffer (up to 200
                 &mgr;M EGTA or BAPTA) were associated with the
                 appearance of steps in the current activation phase and
                 a prevalence of smaller-amplitude Cl(Ca) spikes.
                 Imaging experiments showed that with increased buffer
                 the secretory pole cytosolic Ca2+ signal became
                 fragmented and spatially discrete Ca2+ release events
                 were observed. 3. At higher buffer concentrations
                 (200-500 &mgr;M), increasing concentrations of EGTA
                 increased spike frequency and reduced spike amplitude.
                 In contrast, BAPTA decreased spike frequency and
                 maintained large spike amplitudes. 4. We conclude that,
                 during InsP3-evoked spiking, long-range Ca2+ feedback (
                 approximately 2-4 &mgr;m) shapes the rising phase of
                 the Ca2+ signal by acting to co-ordinate discrete Ca2+
                 release events and short-range ( approximately 40 nm)
                 Ca2+ feedback acts to inhibit further Ca2+ release.",

  abstract =     "The pH within individual organelles of the secretory
                 pathway is believed to be an important determinant of
                 their biosynthetic activity. However, little is known
                 about the determinants and regulation of the pH in the
                 secretory organelles, which cannot be readily accessed
                 by [H+]-sensitive probes. We devised a procedure for
                 the dynamic, noninvasive measurement of pH in the lumen
                 of the endoplasmic reticulum in intact mammalian cells.
                 A recombinant form of the B subunit of Shiga toxin,
                 previously modified to include a carboxyl-terminal KDEL
                 sequence and a pH-sensitive fluorophore, was used for a
                 two-stage delivery strategy. Retrograde traffic of
                 endogenous lipids was harnessed to target this protein
                 to the Golgi complex, followed by retrieval to the
                 endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by KDEL receptors.
                 Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy were
                 used to verify the subcellular localization of the
                 modified B fragment. Fluorescence ratio imaging and two
                 independent calibration procedures were applied to
                 determine the pH of the ER in situ. We found that the
                 pH of the endoplasmic reticulum is near neutral and is
                 unaffected during agonist-induced release of calcium.
                 The ER was found to be highly permeable to H+
                 (equivalents), so that the prevailing [H+] is
                 susceptible to alterations in the cytosolic pH.
                 Plasmalemmal acid-base transporters were shown to
                 indirectly regulate the endoplasmic reticulum pH.",

                 (1992) 605). Here we describe the first use of the
                 silicone elastomer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), for
                 patch clamp electrodes. PDMS is an attractive material
                 for patch clamp recordings. It has low dielectric loss
                 and can be micromolded (Annu. Rev. Mat. Sci. 28 (1998)
                 153) into a shape that mimics the tip of the glass
                 micropipette. Also, the surface chemistry of PDMS may
                 be altered to mimic the hydrophilic nature of glass (J.
                 Appl. Polym. Sci. 14 (1970) 2499; Annu. Rev. Mat. Sci.
                 28 (1998) 153), thereby allowing a high-resistance seal

                 geometry consisting of a PDMS partition with a small
                 aperture sealed between electrode and bath chambers. We
                 demonstrate that a planar PDMS patch electrode, after
                 oxidation of the elastomeric surface, permits patch
                 clamp recording on Xenopus oocytes. Our results

  abstract =     "Internal Stark effect (or internal electrochromy)
                 consists of the shift of light absorption and emission
                 bands under the influence of electric field produced by
                 proximal charges. In the studies of 3-hydroxyflavone
                 (3HF) derivatives exhibiting the excited-state
                 intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), we describe a
                 new phenomenon - a very strong internal electrochromic
                 modulation of this reaction. Fluorescence spectra of
                 3HF derivatives with charged groups attached to the
                 chromophore from the opposite sides without
                 pi-electronic conjugation,
                 N-[(4'-diethylamino)-3-hydroxy-6-flavonyl]methyl-N,N-dimethyloctylammonium
                 bromide and
                 4-{4-[4'-(3-hydroxyflavonyl)]piperazino}-1-(3-sulfopropyl)pyridinium,
                 were compared with those of their neutral analogues in
                 a series of representative solvents. The introduction
                 of the proximal charge results in shifts of absorption
                 spectrum and of both normal (N) and tautomer (T)
                 emission bands, which correspond to initial and
                 phototautomer states of the ESIPT reaction. The
                 observed shifts are in accordance with the Stark effect
                 theory. The direction of the shift depends on the
                 position of the proximal charge with respect to the
                 chromophore. The magnitude of the shift depends
                 strongly on the solvent dielectric constant and on
                 screening or unscreening produced by addition of the
                 hydrophobic salts. In all of these cases, the spectral
                 shifts are accompanied by extremely strong variations
                 of relative intensities of N and T emission bands. This
                 signifies a strong influence of internal electric field
                 on the ESIPT reaction, which produces a dramatic change
                 of emission color. Thus, the coupling of the initial
                 electrochromic sensory signal with the ESIPT reaction
                 allows for the breaking of the limit in magnitude of
                 response inherent to common electrochromic dyes. This
                 suggests a new principle of designing the
                 ultrasensitive electrochromic two-wavelength
                 fluorescence sensors and probes for analytical

                 measurements are limited by baseline drift that can
                 obscure changes in resting membrane potential and by
                 motion artifacts that can obscure repolarization.
                 Voltage-dependent shift of emission wavelengths may
                 allow reduction of drift and motion artifacts by
                 emission ratiometry. We have tested this for action
                 potentials and potassium-induced changes in resting
                 membrane potential in rabbit hearts stained with
                 di-4-ANEPPS [Pyridinium,
                 4-(2-(6-(dibutylamino)-2-naphthalenyl)
                 ethenyl)-1-(3-sulfopropyl)-, hydroxide, inner salt]
                 using laser excitation (488 nm) and a
                 two-photomultiplier tube system or spectrofluorometer
                 (resolution of 500-1,000 Hz and <1 mm). Green and red
                 emissions produced upright and inverted action
                 potentials, respectively. Ratios of green emission to
                 red emission followed action potential contours and
                 exhibited larger fractional changes than either
                 emission alone (P < 0.001). The largest changes and
                 signal-to-noise ratio (signal/noise) were obtained with
                 numerator wavelengths of 525-550 nm and denominator
                 wavelengths of 650-700 nm. Ratiometry lessened drift
                 56-66\% (P < 0.015) and indicated decreases in resting
                 membrane potential. Ratiometry lessened motion
                 artifacts and increased magnitudes of deflections
                 representing phase-zero depolarizations relative to
                 total deflections by 123-188\% in intact hearts (P <
                 0.02). Durations of action potentials at different
                 pacing rates, temperatures, and potassium
                 concentrations were independent of whether they were
                 measured ratiometrically or with microelectrodes (P >/=
                 0.65). The ratiometric calibration slope was 0.017/100
                 mV and decreased with time. Thus emission ratiometry
                 lessens the effects of motion and drift and indicates
                 resting membrane potential changes and
                 repolarization.",

                 may injure myocytes when transmembrane potentials
                 during the pulse exceed the threshold for membrane
                 permeabilization. The location of injury may depend on
                 intrinsic transmembrane potential or influx of calcium
                 by electro-osmosis during the stimulation pulse in
                 addition to the transmembrane potential changes induced
                 by the pulse. We have studied injury by examining
                 contracture and changes in transmembrane
                 potential-sensitive dye fluorescence induced by
                 electric field stimulation (St) with a duration of 20
                 ms and strength of 16-400 V/cm in isolated rabbit
                 ventricular myocytes. St of 100-150 V/cm produced
                 injury in myocytes oriented parallel to the St field
                 frequently without injuring myocytes oriented
                 perpendicular to the field. Injury required calcium in
                 the solution and was asymmetric, occurring first at the
                 myocyte and facing the St anode in 100\% of injured
                 myocytes in normal Tyrode's solution. Injury depended
                 significantly on whether the product of the electric
                 field strength and myocyte length exceeded a threshold
                 of 1.1 V (P < 0.05). Asymmetric injury at the end
                 facing the anode was still present in 96\% of injured
                 myocytes for stimulation after depolarization by an
                 action potential or 20 mM or 125 mM potassium,
                 suggesting that intrinsic transmembrane potential is
                 not responsible for asymmetry. In 125 mM potassium,
                 eliminating calcium from the bathing solution during
                 the St pulse and introducing calcium after the pulse
                 decreased the fraction of injured myocytes in which
                 injury occurred at the end facing the anode to 62\%,
                 suggesting that calcium influx by electro-osmosis at
                 the myocyte end facing the anode contributes to
                 asymmetry. Asymmetric injury at the end facing the
                 anode was still present in 100\% of injured myocytes
                 after adding 1 mM tetraethylammonium chloride,
                 indicating that asymmetry is not sensitive to the
                 potassium channel blockade. For stimulation pulses
                 stronger than 50 V/cm given after depolarization by an
                 action potential, transmembrane potentials at both
                 myocyte ends decayed after the initial deflection
                 indicating that permeabilization occurred at both ends.
                 In conclusion, injury depends on myocyte orientation
                 and is asymmetric occurring first at the myocyte end
                 facing the anode. Asymmetric injury is not explained by
                 asymmetric permeabilization, is independent of the
                 intrinsic transmembrane potential and may result from
                 electro-osmosis during the stimulation pulse.",

                 that unipolar stimulation of anisotropic myocardium
                 produces transmembrane voltage changes (delta VmS) of
                 opposite signs away from the electrode on perpendicular
                 axes. Stimulation with a strength of 0.1 to 40 mA was
                 applied from a point electrode on the left or right
                 ventricle of isolated perfused rabbit hearts at 37
                 degrees C to 38 degrees C stained with the
                 potentiometric dye di-4-ANEPPS. A laser scanner system
                 recorded Vm-sensitive fluorescence at 63 spots in an 8
                 x 8-mm region around the electrode. Cathodal
                 stimulation in the refractory period produced regions
                 of -delta Vm 1 to 5 mm away from the electrode on an
                 axis oriented parallel to the fast propagation axis to
                 within 1.8 +/- 11 degrees (P > or = .7 for difference
                 versus zero, n = 7). Recording spots in these regions
                 underwent + delta Vm when anodal stimulation was used.
                 At recording spots on the slow propagation axis,
                 cathodal stimulation produced + delta Vm and anodal
                 stimulation produced -delta Vm. During diastolic
                 stimulation, early excitation occurred near the
                 electrode for cathodal stimulation or on the fast
                 propagation axis as fas as 2.8 +/- 1 mm away from the
                 electrode for anodal stimulation. A dog-bone region of
                 + delta Vm that included tissue near and away from the
                 electrode on the slow propagation axis occurred when
                 cathodal stimulation was given in diastole. Regions of
                 + delta Vm occurred away from the electrode on the fast
                 propagation axis when anodal stimulation was given in
                 diastole. Thus, delta Vm differs in regions along and
                 across myocardial fibers, indicating that delta Vm
                 depends on anisotropic bidomain properties. Sites of
                 early excitation are those where + delta Vm occurs,
                 indicating that membrane channel excitation depends on
                 the distribution of delta Vm.",

                 were dissimilar to the sparks and puffs described so
                 far, as many arose from clusters of both ryanodine
                 receptors (RyRs) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
                 receptors (InsP3Rs). Increasing either the stimulus
                 strength or loading of the intracellular stores
                 enhanced the frequency of and coupling between
                 elementary release sites and evoked global Ca2+
                 signals. In the PC12 cells, the elementary Ca2+ release
                 preferentially occurred around the branch points.
                 Spatio-temporal recruitment of such elementary release
                 events may regulate neuronal activities.",

  abstract =     "Graded or quantal Ca(2+) release from intracellular
                 stores has been observed in various cell types
                 following activation of either ryanodine receptors
                 (RyR) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors
                 (InsP(3)R). The mechanism causing the release of Ca(2+)
                 stores in direct proportion to the strength of
                 stimulation is unresolved. We investigated the
                 properties of quantal Ca(2+) release evoked by
                 activation of RyR in PC12 cells, and in particular
                 whether the sensitivity of RyR to the agonist caffeine
                 was altered by lumenal Ca(2+). Quantal Ca(2+) release
                 was observed in cells stimulated with 1 to 40 mM
                 caffeine, a range of caffeine concentrations giving a
                 >10-fold change in lumenal Ca(2+) content. The Ca(2+)
                 load of the caffeine-sensitive stores was modulated by
                 allowing them to refill for varying times after
                 complete discharge with maximal caffeine, or by
                 depolarizing the cells with K(+) to enhance their
                 normal steady-state loading. The threshold for RyR
                 activation was sensitized approximately 10-fold as the
                 Ca(2+) load increased from a minimal to a maximal
                 loading. In addition, the fraction of Ca(2+) released
                 by low caffeine concentrations increased. Our data
                 suggest that RyR are sensitive to lumenal Ca(2+) over
                 the full range of Ca(2+) loads that can be achieved in
                 an intact PC12 cell, and that changes in RyR
                 sensitivity may be responsible for the termination of
                 Ca(2+) release underlying the quantal effect.",

                 hypothesis that long-term depression (LTD) of
                 excitatory synaptic transmission in the cerebellar
                 cortex is caused by a rise in postsynaptic Ca
                 concentration. These experiments combined measurements
                 of synaptic efficacy, performed with the thin slice
                 patch clamp technique, with fura-2 measurements of
                 intracellular Ca concentration ([Ca]i) in single
                 cerebellar Purkinje cells. Simultaneous activation of
                 the climbing fiber and parallel fibers innervating
                 single Purkinje cells caused a LTD of transmission of
                 the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell excitatory synapse.
                 This LTD was associated with large and transient rises
                 in [Ca]i in the Purkinje cell and apparently was due to
                 Ca entry through voltage-gated Ca channels in the
                 Purkinje cell dendrites. The rise in [Ca]i produced by
                 climbing fiber activity was necessary for LTD, because
                 addition of the Ca chelator
                 bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate
                 (BAPTA) to the interior of the Purkinje cell blocked
                 LTD. Further, elevation of [Ca]i, produced by
                 depolarizing pulses delivered in conjunction with
                 parallel fiber activation, induced a depression of
                 synaptic activity that closely resembled LTD in both
                 time course and magnitude. Thus, a rise in [Ca]i
                 appears to be sufficient to initiate LTD. From these
                 results, we conclude that LTD of the parallel
                 fiber-Purkinje cell synapse is initiated by a brief,
                 climbing fiber-mediated rise in postsynaptic [Ca]i and
                 that LTD is maintained by other, longer-lived processes
                 that are triggered by the rise in postsynaptic [Ca]i.",

                 of cells to generate intracellular Ca(2+) waves. In
                 this study we have analyzed the cellular and
                 subcellular kinetics of Ca(2+) waves in a
                 neuroendocrine transducer cell, the melanotrope of
                 Xenopus laevis, using the ratiometric Ca(2+) probe
                 indo-1 and video-rate UV confocal laser-scanning
                 microscopy. The purpose of the present study was to
                 investigate how local Ca(2+) changes contribute to a
                 global Ca(2+) signal; subsequently we quantified how a
                 Ca(2+) wave is kinetically reshaped as it is propagated
                 through the cell. The combined kinetics of all
                 subcellular Ca(2+) signals determined the shape of the
                 total cellular Ca(2+) signal, but each subcellular
                 contribution to the cellular signal was not constant in
                 time. Near the plasma membrane, [Ca(2+)](i) increased
                 and decreased rapidly, processes that can be described
                 by a linear and exponential function, respectively. In
                 more central parts of the cell slower kinetics were
                 observed that were best described by a Hill equation.
                 This reshaping of the Ca(2+) wave was modeled with an
                 equation derived from a low-pass RC filter. We propose
                 that the differences in spatial kinetics of the Ca(2+)
                 signal serves as a mechanism by which the same cellular
                 Ca(2+) signal carries different regulatory information
                 to different subcellular regions of the cell, thus
                 evoking differential cellular responses.",

                 identified by kinetic analysis and verified by use of
                 mitochondrial inhibition. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was
                 followed by a rapid Ca2+ efflux ( approximately 1 mmol

                 variety of shapes and sizes of dendritic spines in

                 cultured hippocampal neurons over several hours of
                 observation in a confocal laser scanning microscope. In
                 the absence of extrinsic stimulation, the dimensions of
                 dendritic spines of 3-week-old cultured neurons did not
                 change to any significant degree over 3-4 hr in the

                 Releasing calcium from stores with pulse application of

                 mediated by calcium released from the

                 in the presence of ryanodine blocked this effect on the

                 the mechanism of Ca(2+) signals in individual dendritic
                 spines of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. The
                 experiments focused on the signals that occur during
                 single weak synaptic responses that were subthreshold
                 for triggering postsynaptic action potentials. These
                 Ca(2+) signals were not strongly affected by blocking
                 the EPSPs with the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX. The
                 signals were also not strongly reduced by blocking
                 T-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (VGCCs) with
                 Ni(2+) or by blocking a broad range of VGCCs with
                 intracellular D890. The spine Ca(2+) signals were
                 blocked by NMDA receptor channel (NMDAR) antagonist and
                 had the voltage dependence characteristic of these
                 channels. Neither ryanodine nor cyclopiazonic acid
                 (CPA), substances known to deplete intracellular Ca(2+)
                 stores, substantially reduced the amplitude of
                 synaptically evoked Ca(2+) signals. CPA slowed the
                 recovery phase of Ca(2+) signals in spines produced by
                 synaptic stimulation or by backpropagating action
                 potentials, suggesting a role of intracellular stores
                 in Ca(2+) reuptake. Thus, we find that Ca(2+) release
                 from intracellular stores is not required to produce
                 spine Ca(2+) signals. We conclude that synaptic Ca(2+)
                 signals in spines are primarily caused by Ca(2+) entry
                 through NMDARs. Although these channels are largely
                 blocked by Mg(2+) at voltages near the resting
                 potential, they can nevertheless produce significant
                 Ca(2+) elevation. The resulting Ca(2+) signals are an
                 integral component of individual evoked or spontaneous
                 synaptic events and may be important in the maintenance
                 of synaptic function.",

                 certain G protein-coupled receptor agonists such as
                 lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). These shape changes are
                 driven by Rho-mediated contraction of the
                 actomyosin-based cytoskeleton. To date, however,
                 detection of Rho activation has been hampered by the
                 lack of a suitable assay. Furthermore, the nature of
                 the G protein(s) mediating LPA-induced neurite
                 retraction remains unknown. We have developed a Rho
                 activation assay that is based on the specific binding
                 of active RhoA to its downstream effector Rho-kinase
                 (ROK). A fusion protein of GST and the Rho-binding
                 domain of ROK pulls down activated but not inactive
                 RhoA from cell lysates. Using GST-ROK, we show that in
                 N1E-115 neuronal cells LPA activates endogenous RhoA
                 within 30 s, concomitant with growth cone collapse.
                 Maximal activation occurs after 3 min when neurite
                 retraction is complete and the actin cytoskeleton is
                 fully contracted. LPA-induced RhoA activation is
                 completely inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors
                 (tyrphostin 47 and genistein). Activated Galpha12 and
                 Galpha13 subunits mimic LPA both in activating RhoA and
                 in inducing RhoA-mediated cytoskeletal contraction,
                 thereby preventing neurite outgrowth. We conclude that
                 in neuronal cells, LPA activates RhoA to induce growth
                 cone collapse and neurite retraction through a
                 G12/13-initiated pathway that involves protein-tyrosine
                 kinase activity.",

                 proteins in cells of Dictyostelium discoideum that may
                 be involved in the control of cell motility and
                 chemotaxis, monoclonal antibodies were raised against
                 proteins that had been enriched on an F-actin affinity
                 matrix. One antibody recognized a protein distinguished
                 by its strong accumulation at the tips of filopods.
                 These cell-surface extensions containing a core of
                 bundled actin filaments are rapidly protruded and
                 retracted by cells in the growth-phase stage. The
                 protein of 269 kD turned out to resemble mouse
                 fibroblast talin (Rees et al., 1990) in its primary
                 structure. The fit is best among the first 400-amino
                 acid residues of the NH2-terminal region where identity
                 between the two proteins is 44\% and the last 200-amino
                 acid residues of the COOH-terminal region with 36\%
                 identity. In the elongated cells of the aggregation
                 stage the Dictyostelium talin is accumulated at the
                 entire front where also F-actin is enriched. Since this
                 protein exists in a soluble state in the cytoplasm,
                 mechanisms are predicted that cause accumulation at
                 sites of the cell where a front is established.
                 Evidence for receptor-mediated accumulation was
                 obtained by local stimulation of cells with cAMP. When
                 a new front was induced by the chemoattractant, the
                 talin accumulated there within half a minute,
                 indicating a signal cascade in Dictyostelium
                 responsible for assembly of the talin beneath sites of
                 the plasma membrane where chemoattractant receptors are
                 strongly activated. The ordered assembly of the talin
                 homologue together with actin and a series of other
                 proteins is considered to play a key role in
                 chemotactic orientation.",

                 ([Ca(2+)](c)). We simultaneously monitored
                 glucose-induced changes in [Ca(2+)](c) and in the
                 mitochondrial membrane potential DeltaPsi, as a measure
                 for ATP generation. Increasing the glucose
                 concentration from 0.5 to 15 mM led to the well-known
                 hyperpolarization of DeltaPsi and ATP-dependent
                 lowering of [Ca(2+)](c). However, as soon as
                 [Ca(2+)](c) rose due to the opening of
                 voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, DeltaPsi depolarized
                 and thereafter oscillations in [Ca(2+)](c) were
                 parallel to oscillations in DeltaPsi. A depolarization
                 or oscillations of DeltaPsi cannot be evoked by a
                 substimulatory glucose concentration, but Ca(2+) influx
                 provoked by 30 mM KCl was followed by a depolarization
                 of DeltaPsi. The following feedback loop is suggested:
                 Glucose metabolism via mitochondrial ATP production and
                 closure of K(+)(ATP) channels induces an increase in
                 [Ca(2+)](c). The rise in [Ca(2+)](c) in turn decreases
                 ATP synthesis by depolarizing DeltaPsi, thus
                 transiently terminating Ca(2+) influx. Copyright 2000

  abstract =     "Frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) is a
                 technique for measuring ultrashort laser pulses that
                 involves producing a spectrogram of the pulse and then
                 retrieving the intensity and phase of the electric
                 field using a phase-retrieval algorithm. Since noise on
                 experimental FROG traces reduces the performance of the
                 retrieval algorithm, removing the noise is crucial. In
                 previous work we have shown that subtracting the mean
                 of the noise, optimized lowpass filtering, and
                 suppression of the corners of the trace provides an
                 efficient tool for denoising FROG traces. The recent
                 development of wavelet noise-reduction techniques for
                 signal and image processing now provides a new method
                 for attacking this problem. We apply a two-dimensional
                 discrete wavelet transform to the noisy FROG trace,
                 threshold the wavelet coefficients, and perform the
                 inverse wavelet transform to regain the trace. In
                 combination with other noise-filtering methods, this
                 efficiently removes noise from the trace and improves
                 the algorithm's ability to retrieve the intensity and
                 phase of the pulse accurately, especially in fairly
                 low-noise situations, where extremely high accuracy is
                 desired. In addition to wavelet-coefficient
                 thresholding, we also investigate the possibility of
                 using a geometrical scheme for filtering the wavelet
                 coefficients, thus combining data compression and noise
                 reduction.",

                 cells exposed to a highly focused 150-fs scanning beam
                 at 730, 760, and 800 nm (80 MHz, 80- mu s pixel dwell
                 time) of <or=1 mW remained unaffected by the
                 femtosecond microbeam. However, increased mean power
                 led to impaired cell division. At >or=6-mW mean power,
                 cells were unable to form clones. They died or became
                 giant cells. Complete cell destruction, including cell
                 fragmentation, occurred at mean powers, >10 mW. Cell
                 death was accompanied by intense luminescence in the
                 mitochondrial region. When we consider the
                 diffraction-limited spot size in the submicrometer
                 region, intensities and photon flux densities of 0.8-kW
                 pulses (10-mW mean power) are of the order of terawatts

                 several cancers, particularly childhood leukemias,
                 although negative studies have also been reported.
                 These observations have prompted a broad range of in
                 vitro cellular studies in which effects of ELF EMFs
                 have been observed. However, no reported response has
                 been replicated widely in independent laboratories. One
                 potentially important response is the rapid activation
                 of proto-oncogenes and other genes in human leukemic
                 (HL60) cells and a wide variety of other eukaryotic
                 cells, because of the role of these genes in cell
                 proliferation. We describe quantitative Northern
                 analysis of MYC and beta-actin mRNAs from HL60 cells
                 exposed to fields under conditions very similar to
                 those reported previously to activate these genes,
                 namely 60 Hz sinusoidal magnetic fields of 0.57, 5.7 or
                 57 microT for 20 min. In addition we have used a new
                 design of field-exposure system and introduced a number
                 of other modifications to the protocol to optimize any
                 response. We have also developed a novel method
                 providing enhanced accuracy for the quantitative
                 measurement of mRNA. No significant effect of ELF EMFs
                 on gene expression was observed using any of these

                 reticulum in sea urchin eggs via the ryanodine receptor
                 (RyR) pathway. A similar role has been proposed in
                 cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), although this
                 remains controversial. We therefore investigated the
                 ability of cADPR to induce Ca2+ release from canine
                 cardiac SR microsomes using fluo 3 to monitor
                 extravesicular Ca2+ concentration. We found that cADPR
                 induced Ca2+ release in a concentration-dependent
                 manner, whereas neither its precursor, NAD+, nor its
                 metabolite, ADP-ribose, elicited a consistent effect.
                 In addition, an additive effect on calcium release
                 between cADPR and 9-Me-7-Br-eudistomin-D (MBED), an
                 activator of RyR, was found as well as no
                 cross-desensitization between cADPR and MBED. Specific
                 blockers of the RyR did not abolish the cADPR-induced
                 Ca2+ release. These results provide evidence for
                 cADPR-induced Ca2+ release from dog cardiac SR via a

                 took advantage of the features of dipole radiation in
                 front of a mirror. The fluorescence intensity of a
                 stained membrane on oxidized silicon was measured as a
                 function of the thickness of silicon dioxide up to 1000
                 nm and fitted with an electromagnetic theory accounting
                 for the interference of the exciting light, for the
                 interference of the emitted light and for the change of
                 fluorescence lifetime. We found an angle of 37.8 +-
                 1.6¿ between the transition dipole moment and the
                 membrane normal for an uniaxial cone model of the

                 detect cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals resulting from the
                 discharge of ER Ca2+ stores. Conversely, both the
                 buffering of released Ca2+ and ATP production by
                 mitochondria are predicted to influence ER Ca2+
                 handling, but this complex exchange has been difficult
                 to assess in situ using conventional measurement
                 techniques. Here we have examined this interaction in
                 single intact BHK-21 cells by monitoring intraluminal
                 ER [Ca2+] directly using trapped fluorescent
                 low-affinity Ca2+ indicators. Treatment with
                 mitochondrial inhibitors (FCCP, antimycin A,
                 oligomycin, and rotenone) dramatically prolonged the
                 refilling of stores after release with bradykinin. This
                 effect was largely due to inhibition of Ca2+ entry
                 pathways at the plasma membrane, but a significant
                 component appears to arise from reduction of
                 SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake, possibly as a consequence
                 of ATP depletions in a localized subcellular domain.
                 The rate of bradykinin-induced Ca2+ release was reduced
                 to 51\% of control by FCCP. This effect was largely
                 overcome by loading cells with BAPTA-AM, highlighting
                 the importance of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering in
                 shaping the release kinetics. However,
                 mitochondria-specific ATP production was also a
                 significant determinant of the release dynamic. Our
                 data emphasize the localized nature of the interaction
                 between these organelles, and show that competent
                 mitochondria are essential for generating explosive
                 Ca2+ signals.",

                 brain extend their axons and dendrites into all layers.
                 They are also unusual in having both an axonal and a
                 dendritic zone for the initiation of action potentials.
                 Distal dendritic inputs, which normally appear greatly
                 attenuated at the axon, must cross a high threshold at
                 the dendritic initiation zone to evoke calcium action
                 potentials but can then generate bursts of axonal
                 action potentials. Here we show that a single
                 back-propagating sodium action potential generated in
                 the axon facilitates the initiation of these calcium
                 action potentials when it coincides with distal
                 dendritic input within a time window of several
                 milliseconds. Inhibitory dendritic input can
                 selectively block the initiation of dendritic calcium
                 action potentials, preventing bursts of axonal action
                 potentials. Thus, excitatory and inhibitory
                 postsynaptic potentials arising in the distal dendrites
                 can exert significantly greater control over action
                 potential initiation in the axon than would be expected
                 from their electrotonically isolated locations. The
                 coincidence of a single back-propagating action
                 potential with a subthreshold distal excitatory
                 postsynaptic potential to evoke a burst of axonal
                 action potentials represents a new mechanism by which
                 the main cortical output neurons can associate inputs
                 arriving at different cortical layers.",

                 oscillations based on the allosteric properties of the
                 InsP3 receptor/Ca2+ channel. Our model interprets the
                 cooperatively towards InsP3 saturation, of calcium
                 efflux from intravesicular stores as well as the
                 absence of cooperativity in the binding process of
                 InsP3 on the receptor. It takes into account
                 quantitatively the two antagonist,
                 concentration-dependent effects (fast activator and
                 slow inhibitor) that cytosolic Ca2+ exerts on the InsP3
                 receptor/Ca2+ channel. Assuming that a single pool of
                 releasable Ca2+ exists in the endoplasmic reticulum,
                 the model leads to cytosolic and intravesicular
                 oscillations in Ca2+ at fixed InsP3 concentration.
                 Activation of the receptor by cytosolic calcium is
                 essential for the triggering of oscillations whereas
                 the slow Ca2+ inhibition effect is irrelevant in this
                 respect, although this regulation loop might prevent
                 the system from entering the unstable domain in absence
                 of a true agonist stimulation. Activating cytosolic
                 Ca2+ and InsP3 have quite distinct functions for the
                 induction of Ca2+ release: cytosolic Ca2+ triggers
                 oscillations whereas InsP3 only brings the receptor
                 into a potentially oscillatory regime. Hence, the
                 increasing slope of Ca2+ spiking is constitutively
                 independent from the intensity of the hormonal stimuli
                 in our model, in accord with experimental observations.
                 Comparisons with other existing models are given and
                 additional possible coupling mechanisms are discussed
                 in order to explain particular facts (such as possible
                 oscillations of InsP3) which do not depend on the
                 intrinsic properties of the oscillator.",

                 protrusion and retraction are important in growth cone

                 calcium ion concentration has been shown by several
                 indirect methods to be critically involved in the
                 regulation of filopodial activity. Here, we investigate
                 whether direct elevation of [Ca2+]i, which is
                 restricted in time and space and is isolated from
                 earlier steps in intracellular signaling pathways, can
                 initiate filopodial protrusion. We raised [Ca2+]i level
                 transiently in small areas of nascent axons near growth
                 cones in situ by localized photolysis of caged Ca2+
                 compounds. After photolysis, [Ca2+]i increased from
                 approximately 60 nM to approximately 1 microM within
                 the illuminated zone, and then returned to resting
                 level in approximately 10-15 s. New filopodia arose in
                 this area within 1-5 min, and persisted for
                 approximately 15 min. Elevation of calcium
                 concentration within a single filopodium induced new
                 branch filopodia. In neurons coinjected with
                 rhodamine-phalloidin, F-actin was observed in dynamic
                 cortical patches along nascent axons; after photolysis,
                 new filopodia often emerged from these patches. These
                 results indicate that local transient [Ca2+]i elevation
                 is sufficient to induce new filopodia from nascent
                 axons or from existing filopodia.",

                 some of which adhere to the substrate; to continue

                 Adhesion can be actively regulated, and neutrophils in

                 the cell. We show that the polarized distribution of
                 alpha v beta 3 integrins in migrating neutrophils is
                 maintained by [Ca2+]i-dependent release of adhesion

                 transients in intracellular Ca2+ concentration
                 ([Ca2+]). In addition, the electrophysiological
                 characteristics of neurons were classified by their
                 autaptic currents and intrinsic firing patterns. These
                 data were analysed in order to determine whether a
                 correlation between Ca2+ buffers and
                 electrophysiological type exists. Ca2+ binding ratios
                 of endogenous buffers were estimated by eliciting
                 [Ca2+] transients with short depolarizations, while
                 cells were loaded with fura-2. Two types of estimates
                 could be obtained: one termed kappaS(tau), based on
                 analysing time constants (tau) of [Ca2+] transients,
                 and another termed kappaS(dCa), derived from an
                 analysis of initial amplitudes of [Ca2+] transients.
                 Values for kappaS(tau) and kappaS(dCa) were estimated
                 as 57 +/- 10 (mean +/- s.d., n = 10) and 60 +/- 14 (n =
                 10), respectively, in excitatory neurons, and 130 +/-
                 50 (n = 11) and 150 +/- 70 (n = 11), respectively, in
                 inhibitory neurons. The kappaS values of excitatory and
                 inhibitory cells were significantly different from each
                 other, regardless of the measurement method (Student's
                 t test, P < 0.01). However, there was no significant
                 difference in kappaS between the groups classified
                 according to firing patterns. Although kappaS(tau)
                 values were well matched to those of kappaS(dCa) in
                 most excitatory cells, the two values did not agree in
                 three out of the fourteen inhibitory cells
                 investigated. In these cells, the first few [Ca2+]
                 transients after obtaining the whole cell configuration
                 displayed a double exponential decay, suggesting that
                 buffers with slow binding kinetics, such as
                 parvalbumin, are involved. This hypothesis is further
                 explored in an accompanying paper.",

  abstract =     "kappaS1. The effect of parvalbumin (PV) on [Ca2+]
                 transients was investigated by perfusing adrenal
                 chromaffin cells with fura-2 and fluorescein
                 isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled PV. As PV diffused into
                 cells, the decay of [Ca2+] transients was transformed
                 from monophasic into biphasic. The proportion of the
                 initial fast decay phase increased in parallel with the
                 fluorescence intensity of FITC, indicating that PV is
                 responsible for the initial fast decay phase. The
                 relationship between the fast decay phase and the
                 [Ca2+] level was investigated using depolarizing trains
                 of stimuli. Within a train the relative amplitude of
                 the fast decay phase was inversely dependent on the
                 [Ca2+] level preceding a given stimulus. Based on these
                 observations, we estimated the Ca2+ binding ratio of PV
                 (kappaP), the apparent dissociation constant of PV for
                 Ca2+ (Kdc, app), and the unbinding rate constant of
                 Ca2+ from PV (kc-) in the cytosol of chromaffin cells.
                 Assuming free [Mg2+] to be 0.14 mM, we obtained values
                 of 51.4 +/- 2.0 nM (n = 3) and 0.95 +/- 0.026 s-1 (n =
                 3), for Kdc,app and kc-, respectively. With the
                 parameters obtained in the perfusion study, we
                 simulated [Ca2+] transients, using two different Ca2+
                 extrusion rates (gamma) - 20 and 300 s-1 - which
                 represent typical values for chromaffin cells and
                 neuronal dendrites, respectively. The simulation
                 indicated that Ca2+ is pumped out before it is
                 equilibrated with PV, when gamma is comparable to the
                 equilibration rates between PV and Ca2+, resulting in
                 the fast decay phase of a biexponential [Ca2+]
                 transient. From these results we conclude that Ca2+
                 buffers with slow kinetics, such as PV, may cause
                 biexponential decays in [Ca2+] transients, thereby
                 complicating the analysis of endogenous Ca2+ binding
                 ratios (kappaS) based on time constants. Nevertheless,
                 estimates of kappaS based on Ca2+ increments provide
                 reasonable estimates for Ca2+ binding ratios before
                 equilibration with PV.",

                 electrical activation and mechanical function of the
                 heart. The geometry of the heart is given in terms of
                 prolate spheroidal coordinates defined at the nodes of
                 a finite element mesh and interpolated within elements
                 by a combination of linear Lagrange and cubic Hermite
                 basis functions. Cardiac microstructure is assumed to
                 have three axes of symmetry: one aligned with the
                 muscle fiber orientation (the fiber axis); a second set
                 orthogonal to the fiber direction and lying in the
                 newly identified myocardial sheet plane (the sheet
                 axis); and a third set orthogonal to the first two, in
                 the sheet-normal direction. The geometry, fiber-axis
                 direction, and sheet-axis direction of a dog heart are
                 fitted with parameters defined at the nodes of the
                 finite element mesh. The fiber and sheet orientation
                 parameters are defined with respect to the ventricular
                 geometry such that 1) they can be applied to any heart
                 of known dimensions, and 2) they can be used for the
                 same heart at various states of deformation, as is

  abstract =     "The outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is permeable to
                 various small substances because of the presence of a
                 voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). The voltage
                 dependence of VDAC's permeability is puzzling, because
                 the existence of membrane potential on the OMM has
                 never been shown. We propose that steady-state
                 metabolically derived potential (MDP) may be generated
                 on the OMM as the result of the difference in its
                 permeability restriction for various charged
                 metabolites. To demonstrate the possibility of MDP
                 generation, two models were considered: a liposomal
                 model and a simplified cell model with a creatine
                 kinase energy channeling system. Quantitative
                 computational analysis of the simplified cell model
                 shows that a MDP of up to -5 mV, in addition to the
                 Donnan potential, may be generated at high workloads,
                 even if the OMM is highly permeable to small inorganic
                 ions, including potassium. Calculations show that MDP
                 and DeltapH, generated on the OMM, depend on the
                 cytoplasmic pH and energy demand rate. Computational
                 modeling suggests that MDP may be important for cell
                 energy metabolism regulation in multiple ways,
                 including VDAC's permeability modulation and the effect
                 of electrodynamic compartmentation. The osmotic
                 pressure difference between the mitochondrial
                 intermembrane space and the cytoplasm, as related to
                 the electrodynamic compartmentation effects, might
                 explain the morphological changes in mitochondria under

                 an intracellular calcium chelator, lowered the basal

                 signaling pathways, scaffold proteins might facilitate
                 signal transduction by preforming multimolecular
                 complexes that can be rapidly activated by incoming
                 signal. In many cases, such as mitogen-activated
                 protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, scaffold proteins are
                 necessary for full activation of a signaling pathway.
                 To date, however, no detailed biochemical model of
                 scaffold action has been suggested. Here we describe a
                 quantitative computer model of MAPK cascade with a
                 generic scaffold protein. Analysis of this model
                 reveals that formation of scaffold-kinase complexes can
                 be used effectively to regulate the specificity,
                 efficiency, and amplitude of signal propagation. In
                 particular, for any generic scaffold there exists a
                 concentration value optimal for signal amplitude. The
                 location of the optimum is determined by the
                 concentrations of the kinases rather than their binding
                 constants and in this way is scaffold independent. This
                 effect and the alteration of threshold properties of
                 the signal propagation at high scaffold concentrations
                 might alter local signaling properties at different
                 subcellular compartments. Different scaffold levels and
                 types might then confer specialized properties to tune
                 evolutionarily conserved signaling modules to specific

                 channels in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is
                 analyzed and reduced to a two-variable system. The
                 different time scales in the three basic channel gating
                 processes, namely InsP3 regulation, Ca2+ activation,
                 and Ca2+ inactivation, are revealed and characterized.
                 The method of multiple scales is used in solving the
                 equations on a succession of faster time scales and
                 reducing them to a 2D system. The reduced system,
                 (Vcy/fcy) dC/dt = -P1P3Rm3 infinity
                 h3(C-C0)-PL(C-C0)-Jpump(C); dh/dt = (h infinity-h)/tau

                 dynamics in this model thus involve ER
                 membrane-associated excitability. The reduced system
                 has a bifurcation diagram almost identical to that of
                 the original system and retains the most important
                 dynamic features of the latter. The analysis also shows
                 that the reduced system becomes simpler when the
                 different gating processes are more independent from
                 each other, i.e. when the rates for Ca2+ binding at the
                 site associated with one gating process are independent
                 of occupancy at the other two binding sites. Assuming
                 further that binding of InsP3 does not depend on Ca2+
                 occupancy at the inactivation site, we obtain a minimal

                 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is reviewed. Ca2+
                 excitability refers to the ability of a small increment
                 of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) to trigger
                 a large [Ca2+]i pulse or oscillations. Such nonlinear
                 regenerative behavior is conferred by the existence of
                 IP3 channels and Ca(2+)-ATPase transporters on the ER
                 membrane, which extends throughout the cytoplasm. Ca2+
                 excitability resembles the plasma membrane electrical
                 excitability of neurons and other cells: it is driven
                 by the ionic concentration gradient across the ER
                 membrane (higher Ca2+ concentration inside the ER);
                 each [Ca2+]i spike partially consumes the prestored
                 energy that is reestablished through ATP-dependent
                 active transport; and [Ca2+]i, the excitation variable,
                 controls the nonlinear dynamic release rate of ER Ca2+.
                 This review focuses on the kinetic models based on
                 these features and on experiments dealing with the
                 kinetic properties of [Ca2+]i-dependent gating of the
                 IP3 receptor channel. We summarize evidence in favor of
                 two roles for [Ca2+]i in gating the channel's opening:
                 activation at a rapid time scale and inactivation on a
                 slower time scale. Exploiting an analogy to the
                 well-known Hodgkin-Huxley model for neuronal electrical
                 excitability, we show how Ca2+ excitability of the ER
                 membrane can be explained by these gating properties
                 combined with the ER Ca2+ pump activity. The theory's
                 ability to predict is illustrated by comparing
                 calculated with experimental [Ca2+]i responses for
                 pituitary gonadotrophs under various stimulus
                 conditions. [References: 103]",

                 mobilization leads to depletion of the endoplasmic
                 reticulum (ER) and an increase in Ca2+ entry. We show
                 here for the gonadotroph, an excitable endocrine cell,
                 that sensing of ER Ca2+ content can occur without the
                 Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (Icrac), but rather
                 through the coupling of IP3-induced Ca2+ oscillations
                 to plasma membrane voltage spikes that gate Ca2+ entry.
                 Thus we demonstrate that capacitative Ca2+ entry is
                 accomplished through Ca(2+)-controlled Ca2+ entry. We
                 develop a comprehensive model, with parameter values
                 constrained by available experimental data, to simulate
                 the spatiotemporal behavior of agonist-induced Ca2+
                 signals in both the cytosol and ER lumen of
                 gonadotrophs. The model combines two previously
                 developed models, one for ER-mediated Ca2+ oscillations
                 and another for plasma membrane potential-driven Ca2+
                 oscillations. Simulations show agreement with existing
                 experimental records of store content, cytosolic Ca2+
                 concentration ([Ca2+]i), and electrical activity, and
                 make a variety of new, experimentally testable
                 predictions. In particular, computations with the model
                 suggest that [Ca2+]i in the vicinity of the plasma
                 membrane acts as a messenger for ER content via
                 Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels and Ca2+ pumps in the
                 plasma membrane. We conclude that, in excitable cells
                 that do not express Icrac, [Ca2+]i profiles provide a
                 sensitive mechanism for regulating net calcium flux
                 through the plasma membrane during both store depletion

                 waves and oscillations in levels of cytosolic free
                 calcium(1-5). To determine which longer-term responses
                 are controlled by oscillations in InsP(3) and cytosolic
                 free calcium, it would be useful to deliver exogenous
                 InsP(3), under spatial and temporal control, into
                 populations of unpermeabilized cells. Here we report
                 the 15-step synthesis of a membrane-permeant, caged
                 InsP(3) derivative from myo-inositol. This derivative
                 diffused into intact cells and was hydrolysed to
                 produce a caged, metabolically stable InsP(3)
                 derivative. This latter derivative accumulated in the
                 cytosol at concentrations of hundreds of micromolar,
                 without activating the InsP(3) receptor. Ultraviolet
                 illumination uncaged an InsP(3) analogue nearly as

                 via the nuclear factor of activated T cells(6,7). The

                 0.5- or greater than or equal to 2-minute intervals, as
                 a single pulse, or as a slow sustained plateau, Thus,
                 oscillations in cytosolic free calcium levels at

                 for a given amount of InsP(3).",

  abstract =     "The role of microtubules (MTs) in cell locomotion is
                 uncertain: while MTs are not essential for motility of
                 certain cells, MTs are necessary for the directed
                 translocation of large cells such as fibroblasts,
                 endothelial cells and neuronal growth cones. Based on
                 previous studies, we hypothesize that cell locomotion
                 may involve MTs in two possible ways: (1) the rate of
                 cell locomotion is proportional to MT level; or (2)
                 cell locomotion is not proportional to MT level but
                 requires a critical level of MTs to proceed. To test
                 these hypotheses, we measured the rate of locomotion of
                 NRK fibroblasts migrating into an in vitro wound,
                 before and after treatment with different
                 concentrations of nocodazole to generate cells with
                 different levels of MTs. Locomotion of cells was
                 monitored directly using timelapse recording and
                 analyzed with an Image-1 image analysis program.
                 Addition of nocodazole (> or = 50 nM) resulted in a
                 rapid reduction in locomotion to a new rate that was
                 maintained for > 2 hours. We found that addition of as
                 little as 100 nM nocodazole decreased the rate of
                 locomotion by more than 60\%; and that 300 nM
                 nocodazole completely stopped cell locomotion. Although
                 100 nM nocodazole decreased locomotion over 60\%, we
                 detected no qualitative change in MT distribution by
                 immunofluorescence. Quantitative analysis of MT
                 fluorescence in immunofluorescently stained
                 preparations showed that 100 nM nocodazole had no
                 detectable effect on MT levels and that 300 nM
                 nocodazole only decreased MT levels to approximately
                 40\% of controls. Quantitative analysis of tubulin
                 polymer levels by cell extraction and western blotting
                 yielded results similar to those obtained by
                 quantification of MT fluorescence. A comparison of the
                 locomotion rate measurements with the MT level
                 measurements indicated that over half of the cell
                 locomotion rate could be blocked by nocodazole without
                 significantly affecting MT levels in the cell; the
                 remaining locomotion rate was reduced proportionally to
                 MT levels. These results do not support the notion that
                 a critical level of MTs is required for cell locomotion
                 and suggest that only a portion (< 50\%) of the speed
                 of the cells is proportional to MT levels. Rather, by
                 analogy with studies of MT antagonists on the mitotic
                 spindle, they suggest a third possibility: that low
                 concentrations of nocodazole interfere with MT dynamics
                 and thus, MT dynamics are critical for the maximal
                 speed of cell locomotion. This notion was further
                 supported by analogous effects of taxol and vinblastine
                 on cell locomotion: at concentrations that reportedly
                 cause little change in the level of MTs, taxol and
                 vinblastine also dramatically decreased the rate of
                 locomotion of NRK cells. In summary, our results
                 establish the relationship between microtubule levels
                 and locomotion rate and suggest that dynamic MTs are
                 rate-limiting for fibroblast locomotion.",

                 fluorescence imaging, we studied intracellular calcium
                 (Ca2+i) dynamics in cerebellar basket cells, whose
                 dendrites, axon and presynaptic terminals are coplanar,
                 an optimal configuration for simultaneous optical
                 measurements of all functional domains. 2. In
                 Cs(+)-loaded neurones, depolarizing pulses induced
                 large Ca2+i transients in single axonal varicosities
                 and synaptic terminals, contrasting with much weaker
                 signals between varicosities or in the somato-dendritic
                 domain. 3. Axonal branch points consistently displayed
                 [Ca2+]i rises of similar magnitude and time course to
                 those in axonal terminals and varicosities. 4. In
                 biocytin-filled basket cells, varicosity-like swellings
                 were present along the axon including its branch
                 points. Thus, axonal enlargements are not due to
                 fluorescence-induced cell damage. 5. The spatial
                 heterogeneity of Ca2+i signals was also observed in
                 K(+)-loaded cells upon depolarizing trains, suggesting
                 that this behaviour is an intrinsic property of Ca2+i
                 homeostasis in basket cells. 6. We conclude that
                 depolarization of basket cell axons evokes high local
                 Ca2+i signals in synaptic terminals, en passant
                 varicosities and branch points. While high [Ca2+]i in
                 presynaptic structures presumably triggers transmitter
                 release, Ca2+i transients at branch points may control
                 signal transmission in the axonal arborization.",

                 known as the P-type channel has recently been

                 Purkinje cells (and thus the name), is not blocked by
                 dihydropyridines or by omega-conotoxin (GVIA), but is
                 blocked by native funnel-web spider venom and by a
                 polyamine (FTX) extracted from such venom. In addition,
                 a synthetic polyamine (sFTX) has been produced that
                 also specifically blocks P-channels in brain slices and

                 compartmentalized distribution of H+ ions across
                 membrane-bound organelles. However, measurements of
                 organelle pH in living cells have been scarce. Several
                 mutants of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent
                 protein (GFP) displayed a pH-dependent absorbance and
                 fluorescent emission, with apparent pKa values ranging
                 from 6.15 (mutations F64L/S65T/H231L) and 6.4
                 (K26R/F64L/S65T/Y66W/N146I/M153T/ V163A/N164H/H231L) to
                 a remarkable 7.1 (S65G/S72A/T203Y/H231L). We have
                 targeted these GFPs to the cytosol plus nucleus, the
                 medial/trans-Golgi by fusion with
                 galactosyltransferase, and the mitochondrial matrix by
                 using the targeting signal from subunit IV of
                 cytochrome c oxidase. Cells in culture transfected with
                 these cDNAs displayed the expected subcellular
                 localization by light and electron microscopy and
                 reported local pH that was calibrated in situ with
                 ionophores. We monitored cytosolic and nuclear pH of
                 HeLa cells, and mitochondrial matrix pH in HeLa cells
                 and in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. The pH of the
                 medial/trans-Golgi was measured at steady-state
                 (calibrated to be 6.58 in HeLa cells) and after various
                 manipulations. These demonstrated that the Golgi
                 membrane in intact cells is relatively permeable to H+,
                 and that Cl- serves as a counter-ion for H+ transport
                 and likely helps to maintain electroneutrality. The
                 amenability to engineer GFPs to specific subcellular
                 locations or tissue targets using gene fusion and
                 transfer techniques should allow us to examine pH at
                 sites previously inaccessible.",

                 An intuitive JAVA interface allows access via a web

                 axon were examined. A zwitterionic styryl dye displays
                 transmittance and excitation spectra on the
                 voltage-clamped squid axon with shapes similar to those
                 previously measured on a model membrane system and
                 consistent with a postulated electrochromic mechanism.
                 The speed of the transmittance response is faster than
                 1.2 microseconds. The size of the fluorescence change
                 is a factor of forty lower than on the model membrane;
                 this diminution can be rationalized in terms of the
                 background fluorescence from Schwann cells and the
                 non-optimal geometric arrangement of the axon membrane.
                 When the emission spectrum is dissected from the
                 excitation response, a non-electrochromic component is
                 found. This component might result from molecular
                 motion during the excited state lifetime. A positively
                 charged dye permeates the axon membrane and displays
                 complex response waveforms dependent on the method of
                 application and the axon holding potential. This
                 contrasts markedly with model membrane results where

  abstract =     "The fast potentiometric indicator di-4-ANEPPS is
                 examined in four different preparations: lipid
                 vesicles, red blood cells, squid giant axon and guinea
                 pig heart. The dye gives consistent potentiometric
                 responses in each of these systems, although some of
                 the detailed behavior varies. In lipid vesicles, the
                 dye displays an increase in fluorescence combined with
                 a red shift of the excitation spectrum upon
                 hyperpolarization. Similar behavior is found in red
                 cells where a dual wavelength radiometric measurement
                 is also demonstrated. The signal-to-noise ratio of the
                 potentiometric fluorescence response is among the best
                 ever recorded on the voltage-clamped squid axon. The
                 dye is shown to be a faithful and persistent monitor of
                 cardiac action potentials with no appreciable loss of
                 signal or deterioration of cardiac activity for periods
                 as long as 2 hr with intermittent illumination every 10
                 min. These results, together with previously published
                 applications of the dye to a spherical lipid bilayer
                 model and to cells in culture, demonstrate the
                 versatility of di-4-ANEPPS as a fast indicator of
                 membrane potential.",

                 Ca2+ from intracellular stores since they could be
                 generated even when the cells were incubated in
                 Ca(2+)-free medium. In contrast, when the cells were
                 depolarized with high K+ in Ca(2+)-containing medium,
                 increases of cytosolic Ca2+ occurred in the neurites
                 but failed to evolve into waves. Depending on the
                 receptor agonist employed (bradykinin and carbachol
                 versus ATP) the orientation of the waves could be
                 opposite, from the neurite tip to the cell body or vice
                 versa, suggesting different and specific distribution
                 of the responsible surface receptors. Cytosolic Ca2+
                 imaging results, together with studies of inositol
                 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation in intact cells and
                 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release from
                 microsomes, revealed the sustaining process of the
                 waves to be discharge of Ca2+ from the inositol
                 1,4,5-trisphosphate- (and not the ryanodine-) sensitive
                 stores distributed along the neurites. The activation
                 of the cognate receptor appears to result from the
                 coordinate action of the second messenger and Ca2+.
                 Because of their properties and orientation, the waves
                 could participate in the control of not only
                 conventional cell activities, but also excitability and
                 differential processing of inputs, and thus of
                 electrochemical computation in nerve cells.",

                 Ca2+ entry into pancreatic acinar cells, a process
                 known as capacitative calcium entry. In cells loaded
                 with the calcium chelator BAPTA, the transient Ca2+
                 release was blunted and the rise of [Ca2+]i on
                 readdition of Ca2+ was slowed. However, the
                 steady-state [Ca2+]i due to Ca2+ entry was
                 substantially augmented compared with control cells.
                 This indicates that [Ca2+]i exerts a negative feedback
                 on Ca2+ entry from a compartment buffered by BAPTA and
                 separated from the bulk of cytoplasmic Ca2+. This
                 interaction probably occurs close to the calcium
                 channel where [Ca2+] is higher than in the bulk of the
                 cytoplasm. In support of this interpretation, the
                 slower Ca2+ chelator, EGTA, also blunted the release of
                 Ca2+ and slowed the rise of the sustained [Ca2+]i phase
                 but failed to augment steady-state [Ca2+]i. In
                 contrast, Ca2+ entry in NIH 3T3 cells was characterized
                 by a transient rise of [Ca2+]i that decays to near
                 prestimulus levels. This decay in Ca2+ entry also
                 results from negative feedback by Ca2+ because the
                 decrease in Ca2+ entry was reversed by incubation in a
                 Ca2+-deficient medium. However, unlike its effects in
                 acinar cells, BAPTA neither augmented steady-state
                 [Ca2+]i nor prevented the inactivation of entry.
                 Rather, in BAPTA-loaded cells, [Ca2+]i failed to
                 increase substantially suggesting that negative
                 regulation by Ca2+ may occur at a site distinct from
                 the cytoplasmic compartment and inaccessible to
                 cytoplasmic BAPTA. These two distinct types of feedback
                 behavior may indicate subtypes of store-operated
                 calcium channels expressed in different cells or a
                 single type of channel which is differentially

                 investigate the transition of localized Ca2+ releases
                 induced by focal caffeine stimulation into propagating
                 Ca2+ waves in isolated rat ventricular myocytes. 2.
                 Self-sustaining Ca2+ waves could be initiated when the
                 cellular Ca2+ load was increased by elevating the
                 extracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]o) and they could also be
                 initiated at normal Ca2+ loads when the sensitivity of
                 the release sites to cytosolic Ca2+ was enhanced by low
                 doses of caffeine. When we prevented the accumulation
                 of extra Ca2+ in the luminal compartment of the
                 sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with thapsigargin, focal
                 caffeine pulses failed to trigger self-sustaining Ca2+
                 waves on elevation of [Ca2+]o. Inhibition of SR Ca2+
                 uptake by thapsigargin in cells already preloaded with
                 Ca2+ above normal levels did not prevent local Ca2+
                 elevations from triggering propagating waves. Moreover,
                 wave velocity increased by 20 \%. Tetracaine (0.75 mM)
                 caused transient complete inhibition of both local and
                 propagating Ca2+ signals, followed by full recovery of
                 the responses due to increased SR Ca2+ accumulation. 3.
                 Computer simulations using a numerical model with
                 spatially distinct Ca2+ release sites suggested that
                 increased amounts of releasable Ca2+ might not be
                 sufficient to generate self-sustaining Ca2+ waves under
                 conditions of Ca2+ overload unless the threshold of
                 release site Ca2+ activation was set at relatively low
                 levels (< 1.5 microM). 4. We conclude that the
                 potentiation of SR Ca2+ release channels by luminal
                 Ca2+ is an important factor in Ca2+ wave generation.
                 Wave propagation does not require the translocation of
                 Ca2+ from the spreading wave front into the SR.
                 Instead, it relies on luminal Ca2+ sensitizing Ca2+
                 release channels to cytosolic Ca2+.",

                 cells the activation of the mitogen-activated protein
                 kinases ERK1 and ERK2 by the mitochondrial uncoupler
                 carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone
                 (FCCP). This treatment slowly decreases ATP levels to
                 30\% of control, whereas the internal calcium level
                 rises very rapidly to 250\% of control, derived from
                 internal stores. Tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1 and
                 ERK2 increases gradually, starting after 5 min of
                 treatment, to reach a maximum at 30 min; the kinase
                 activity reaches 250\% when measured after 1 hr of
                 treatment. The drop in ATP levels is slower still.
                 Comparison of the time courses of the rapid rise in
                 cytosolic calcium with the slower increase in ERK1 and
                 ERK2 activation suggests one or more intermediate
                 stages in this pathway. Chelation of cytosolic calcium
                 with dimethyl
                 bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid

                 as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation and the
                 activation of the ERKs. Surprisingly, caffeine, which
                 releases calcium from different internal stores, did
                 not increase the tyrosine phosphorylation and did not
                 activate the ERKs. The FCCP effect on calcium storage
                 may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction in
                 Alzheimer disease, which might result in ineffective
                 buffering of cytosolic calcium that leads to
                 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and

                 1,4,5-trisphosphate ([IP3]) in small regions of single

                 combined with capillary electrophoresis. This method is
                 10, 000 times more sensitive than all existing assays
                 enabling subcellular measurement of [IP3] in Xenopus
                 oocytes. Upon addition of lysophosphatidic acid to an
                 oocyte, [IP3] increased from 40 to 650 nM within 2 min.
                 IP3 concentrations as high as 1.8 microM were measured
                 after activation with lysophosphatidic acid, suggesting
                 that the physiologic concentration of IP3 ranges from

                 for intraterminal Ca2+ stores to regulate exocytosis of
                 dense-cored vesicles (DCVs) and whether these stores
                 can modulate exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, we
                 studied the spatial distributions of DCVs, smooth
                 endoplasmic reticulum (SER), and mitochondria in 19
                 serially reconstructed nerve terminals in bullfrog
                 sympathetic ganglia. On average, each bouton had three
                 active zones, 214 DCVs, 26 SER fragments (SERFs), and
                 eight mitochondria. DCVs, SERFs and mitochondria were
                 located, on average, 690, 624, and 526 nm,
                 respectively, away from active zones. Virtually no DCVs
                 were within docking (i.e., < or = 50 nm) distances of
                 the active zones. Thus, it is unlikely that DCV
                 exocytosis occurs at active zones via mechanisms
                 similar to those for exocytosis of synaptic vesicles.
                 Because there were virtually no SERFs or mitochondria
                 within 50 nm of any active zone, Ca2+ modulation by
                 these organelles is unlikely to affect ACh release
                 evoked by a single action potential. In contrast, 30\%
                 of DCVs and 40\% of SERFs were located within 50 nm of
                 the nonspecialized regions of the plasma membrane.
                 Because each bouton had at least one SERF within 50 nm
                 of the plasma membrane and most of these SERFs had
                 DCVs, but not mitochondria, near them, it is possible
                 for Ca2+ release from the SER to provide the Ca2+
                 necessary for DCV exocytosis. The fact that 60\% of the
                 mitochondria had some part within 50 nm of the plasma
                 membrane means that it is possible for mitochondrial
                 Ca2+ buffering to affect DCV exocytosis.",

                 store-operated channels (SOCs) is crucial to Ca2+
                 signaling but has eluded detection. SOCs may be
                 functionally related to the TRP family of
                 receptor-operated channels. Direct comparison of
                 endogenous SOCs with stably expressed TRP3 channels in

                 However, condensed cortical F-actin prevented
                 activation of both SOC and TRP3 channels, which
                 suggests that ER-PM interactions underlie coupling of

                 of all types of liposomes containing PS showed biphasic
                 patterns. Their pH thresholds were found in the pH
                 range of 5-6 and shifted to lower pH values with
                 decrease in the PS content. Similar shifts were

                 vesicles, only small degrees of fusion and clathrin

                 may adopt different conformational states in the pH
                 region where it induced membrane fusion. In addition,

                 that two distinct fusion-active states exist at pH 2-6,
                 which might be related to the biphasic fusion patterns.

                 uptake by way of the F1Fzero-ATPase (adapted from D.
                 Pietrobon and S. Caplan. Biochemistry 24: 5764-5778,
                 1985), a proton leak, adenine nucleotide exchange, the
                 Ca2+ uniporter, and Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Each mechanism
                 is developed separately into a kinetic model for the
                 rate of transport, with parameters taken from
                 experiments on isolated mitochondrial preparations.
                 These mechanisms are combined in a modular fashion
                 first to describe state 4 (nonphosphorylating) and
                 state 3 (phosphorylating) mitochondria with
                 mitochondrial NADH and Ca2+ concentrations as fixed

                 Physiol. 43): C1158-C1173, 1998], we describe the
                 development of a kinetic model for the interaction of
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ handling and electrical activity in
                 the pancreatic beta-cell. Here we describe further
                 results of those simulations, focusing on mitochondrial
                 variables, the rate of respiration, and fluxes of
                 metabolic intermediates as a function of D-glucose
                 concentration. Our simulations predict relatively
                 smooth increases of O2 consumption, adenine nucleotide
                 transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP
                 production by the tricarboxylic acid cycle as D-glucose
                 concentrations are increased from basal to 20 mM. On
                 the other hand, we find that the active fraction of
                 pyruvate dehydrogenase saturates, due to increases in
                 matrix Ca2+, near the onset of bursting electrical
                 activity and that the NADH/NAD+ ratio in the
                 mitochondria increases by roughly an order of magnitude
                 as glucose concentrations are increased. The
                 mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio increases by factor of < 2
                 between the D-glucose threshold for bursting and
                 continuous spiking. According to our simulations,
                 relatively small changes in mitochondrial membrane
                 potential (approximately 1 mV) caused by uptake of Ca2+
                 are sufficient to alter the cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio
                 and influence ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the plasma
                 membrane. In the simulations, these cyclic changes in
                 the mitochondrial membrane potential are due to
                 synchronization of futile cycle of Ca2+ from the
                 cytoplasm through mitochondria via Ca2+ uniporters and
                 Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Our simulations predict steady
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations on the order of 0.1
                 microM at low glucose concentrations that become
                 oscillatory with an amplitude on the order of 0.5
                 microM during bursting. Abrupt increases in
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration > 5 microM may occur
                 during continuous electrical activity.",

                 1997] is expanded to include the D-glucose dependence
                 of the rate of production of mitochondrial reducing
                 equivalents. The Ca2+ dependence of the mitochondrial
                 dehydrogenases, which is also included in the model,
                 plays only a small role in the simulations, since the
                 dehydrogenases appear to be maximally activated when
                 D-glucose concentrations are sufficient to produce
                 bursting. A previous model of ionic currents in the
                 plasma membrane is updated using a recent experimental
                 characterization of the dependence of the conductance
                 of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) current on adenine
                 nucleotides. The resulting whole cell model is complex,
                 involving 12 dynamic variables that couple Ca2+
                 handling in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria with
                 electrical activity in the plasma and inner
                 mitochondrial membranes. Simulations with the whole
                 cell model give rise to bursting electrical activity
                 similar to that seen in pancreatic islets and clusters
                 of pancreatic beta-cells. The full D-glucose dose
                 response of electrical activity is obtained if the
                 cytosolic rate of ATP hydrolysis is a sigmoidal
                 function of glucose. The simulations give the correct
                 shape, period, and phase of the associated oscillations
                 in cytosolic Ca2+, predict that the conductance of the
                 KATP current oscillates out of phase with electrical
                 activity [as recently observed in ob/ob mice (O.

                 this model, bursting results because Ca2+ uptake into
                 mitochondria during the active phase reduces the
                 mitochondrial inner membrane potential, reducing the
                 rate of production of ATP, which in turn activates the
                 KATP current and repolarizes the plasma membrane.",

                 Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (InsP4), a putative

                 initially found in the periphery of the cell bodies of
                 the neonatal neurons; was progressively enriched in the
                 developing dendritic arborization during the first
                 postnatal weeks where it remained exclusively localized

                 vesicle is much larger than the number of postsynaptic
                 receptors. But does release of a single vesicle
                 normally saturate these receptors? Answering this
                 question is critical to understanding how the amplitude
                 and variability of synaptic transmission are set and
                 regulated. Here we describe the use of two-photon
                 microscopy to image transient increases in Ca2+
                 concentration mediated by NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)
                 receptors in single dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal

                 a single release event does not saturate spine NMDA
                 receptors; a second release occurring 10 ms later
                 produces approximately 80\% more NMDA-receptor

                 CNS and compartmentalize calcium. Although the
                 mechanisms of calcium influx into spines have been
                 explored, it is unknown what determines the calcium
                 decay kinetics in spines. With two-photon microscopy we
                 investigate action potential-induced calcium dynamics
                 in spines from rat CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices. The
                 [Ca(2+)](i) in most spines shows two decay kinetics: an
                 initial fast component, during which [Ca(2+)](i) in
                 spines decays to dendritic levels, followed by a slower
                 decay phase in which the spine follows dendritic
                 kinetics. The correlation between [Ca(2+)](i) in spine
                 and dendrite at the breakpoint of the decay kinetics
                 demonstrates diffusional equilibration between spine
                 and dendrite during the slower component. To explain
                 the faster initial decay, we rule out saturation or
                 kinetic effects of endogenous or exogenous buffers and
                 focus instead on (1) active calcium extrusion and (2)
                 buffered diffusion of calcium from spine to dendrite.
                 The presence of an undershoot in most spines indicates
                 that extrusion mechanisms can be intrinsic to the
                 spine. Supporting the two mechanisms, pharmacological
                 blockade of smooth endoplasmic reticulum calcium
                 (SERCA) pumps and the length of the spine neck affect
                 spine decay kinetics. Using a mathematical model, we
                 find that the contribution of calcium pumps and
                 diffusion varies from spine to spine. We conclude that
                 dendritic spines have calcium pumps and that their
                 density and kinetics, together with the morphology of
                 the spine neck, determine the time during which the
                 spine compartmentalizes calcium.",

                 examine regulation of channel gating of the type 3
                 isoform, recombinant rat type 3 InsP(3)R (r-InsP(3)R-3)
                 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and single-channel

                 the presence of 0.5 mM cytoplasmic free ATP,
                 r-InsP(3)R-3 gating was inhibited by high [Ca(2+)](i)

                 inhibition of channel gating had an inhibitory Hill

                 saturating (10 &mgr;M) cytoplasmic InsP(3)
                 concentrations ([InsP(3)]). At [InsP(3)] < 100 nM, the
                 r-InsP(3)R-3 became more sensitive to Ca(2+)
                 inhibition, with the InsP(3) concentration dependence
                 of K(inh) described by a half-maximal [InsP(3)] of 55
                 nM and a Hill coefficient of approximately 4. InsP(3)
                 activated the type 3 channel by tuning the efficacy of
                 Ca(2+) to inhibit it, by a mechanism similar to that
                 observed for the type 1 isoform. In contrast, the
                 r-InsP(3)R-3 channel was uniquely distinguished from
                 the X-InsP(3)R-1 channel by its enhanced Ca(2+)
                 sensitivity of activation (half-maximal activating
                 [Ca(2+)](i) of 77 nM instead of 190 nM) and lack of
                 cooperativity between Ca(2+) activation sites
                 (activating Hill coefficient of 1 instead of 2). These
                 differences endow the InsP(3)R-3 with high gain

                 Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release properties complementary
                 to those of InsP(3)R-1. Thus, distinct Ca(2+) signals

                 sites of the InsP(3)-liganded type 3 channel
                 distinguished the two isoforms. Because Ca(2+)
                 activation of type 1 channel was the target of
                 regulation by cytoplasmic ATP free acid concentration
                 ([ATP](i)), here we studied the effects of [ATP](i) on
                 the dependence of r-InsP(3)R-3 gating on cytoplasmic
                 free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). As [ATP](i)
                 was increased from 0 to 0.5 mM, maximum r-InsP(3)R-3
                 channel open probability (P(o)) remained unchanged,
                 whereas the half-maximal activating [Ca(2+)](i) and
                 activation Hill coefficient both decreased
                 continuously, from 800 to 77 nM and from 1.6 to 1,
                 respectively, and the half-maximal inhibitory
                 [Ca(2+)](i) was reduced from 115 to 39 &mgr;M. These
                 effects were largely due to effects of ATP on the mean
                 closed channel duration. Whereas the r-InsP(3)R-3 had a
                 substantially higher P(o) than X-InsP(3)R-1 in
                 activating [Ca(2+)](i) (<1 &mgr;M) and 0.5 mM ATP, the
                 Ca(2+) dependencies of channel gating of the two
                 isoforms became remarkably similar in the absence of

                 (InsP3R), a Ca2+-release channel localized to the
                 endoplasmic reticulum, plays a critical role in
                 generating complex cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals in many
                 cell types. Three InsP3R isoforms are expressed in
                 different subcellular locations, at variable relative
                 levels with heteromultimer formation in different cell
                 types. A proposed reason for this diversity of InsP3R
                 expression is that the isoforms are differentially
                 inhibited by high cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentrations
                 ([Ca2+]i), possibly due to their different interactions
                 with calmodulin. Here, we have investigated the
                 possible roles of calmodulin and bath [Ca2+] in
                 mediating high [Ca2+]i inhibition of InsP3R gating by
                 studying single endogenous type 1 InsP3R channels
                 through patch clamp electrophysiology of the outer
                 membrane of isolated Xenopus oocyte nuclei. Neither
                 high concentrations of a calmodulin antagonist nor
                 overexpression of a dominant-negative Ca2+-insensitive
                 mutant calmodulin affected inhibition of gating by high
                 [Ca2+]i. However, a novel, calmodulin-independent
                 regulation of [Ca2+]i inhibition of gating was
                 revealed: whereas channels recorded from nuclei kept in
                 the regular bathing solution with [Ca2+] [~]400 nM were
                 inhibited by 290 {micro}M [Ca2+]i, exposure of the
                 isolated nuclei to a bath solution with ultra-low
                 [Ca2+] (<5 nM, for [~]300 s) before the patch-clamp
                 experiments reversibly relieved Ca2+ inhibition, with
                 channel activities observed in [Ca2+]i up to 1.5 mM.
                 Although InsP3 activates gating by relieving high
                 [Ca2+]i inhibition, it was nevertheless still required
                 to activate channels that lacked high [Ca2+]i
                 inhibition. Our observations suggest that high [Ca2+]i
                 inhibition of InsP3R channel gating is not regulated by
                 calmodulin, whereas it can be disrupted by
                 environmental conditions experienced by the channel,
                 raising the possibility that presence or absence of
                 high [Ca2+]i inhibition may not be an immutable
                 property of different InsP3R isoforms. Furthermore,
                 these observations support an allosteric model in which
                 Ca2+ inhibition of the InsP3R is mediated by two Ca2+
                 binding sites, only one of which is sensitive to

                 receptors (IP3R) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
                 activates Ca2+ release from the ER lumen to the
                 cytoplasm, generating complex cytoplasmic Ca2+
                 concentration signals including temporal oscillations
                 and propagating waves. IP3-mediated Ca2+ release is
                 also controlled by cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration with
                 both positive and negative feedback. Single-channel
                 properties of the IP3R in its native ER membrane were
                 investigated by patch clamp electrophysiology of
                 isolated Xenopus oocyte nuclei to determine the
                 dependencies of IP3R on cytoplasmic Ca2+ and IP3
                 concentrations under rigorously defined conditions.
                 Instead of the expected narrow bell-shaped cytoplasmic
                 free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) response centered
                 at approximate to 300 nM-1 mu M, the open probability
                 remained elevated (approximate to 0.8) in the presence
                 of saturating levels (10 mu M) of IP3, even as [Ca2+]i
                 was raised to high concentrations, displaying two
                 distinct types of functional Ca2+ binding sites:
                 activating sites with half-maximal activating [Ca2+](i)
                 (K-act) of 210 nM and Hill coefficient (H-act)
                 approximate to 2; and inhibitory sites with
                 half-maximal inhibitory [Ca2+](i) (K-inh) Of 54 mu M

                 functional half-maximal activating IP3 concentration
                 (K-IP3) of 50 nM and Hill coefficient (H-IP3) of 4 for
                 IP3, These results demonstrate that Ca2+ is a true
                 receptor agonist, whereas the sole function of IP3 is
                 to relieve Ca2+ inhibition of IP3R. Allosteric tuning
                 of Ca2+ inhibition by IP3 enables the individual IP3R
                 Ca2+ channel to respond in a graded fashion, which has
                 implications for localized and global cytoplasmic Ca2+
                 concentration signaling and quantal Ca2+ release.",

                 Cytoplasmic ATP free-acid ([ATP](i)), but not the MgATP
                 complex, activated gating of the InsP(3)-liganded
                 InsP(3)R, by stabilizing open channel state(s) and
                 destabilizing the closed state(s). Activation was
                 associated with a reduction of the half-maximal

                 channels. The resulting hyperpolarization promotes
                 capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE), which, unlike BKCa
                 channels, is inhibited by high Ca2+. To understand how
                 the coordinated activation of plasma membrane ion
                 channels with opposite Ca2+ sensitivity is
                 orchestrated, the individual contribution of
                 mitochondria and ER in regulation of subplasmalemmal
                 Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]pm) was investigated. For
                 organelle visualization, cells were transfected with
                 DsRed and yellow cameleon targeted to mitochondria and
                 ER. The patch pipette was placed far from any organelle
                 (L1), close to ER (L3), or mitochondria (L2) and
                 activity of BKCa channels was used to estimate local
                 [Ca2+]pm. Under standard patch conditions (130 mM K+ in
                 the bath), histamine increased [Ca2+]pm at L1 and L3 to
                 ~1.6 {micro}M, whereas close to mitochondria [Ca2+]pm
                 remained unchanged. If mitochondria moved apart from
                 the pipette or in the presence of carbonyl
                 cyanide-4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhyrazone, [Ca2+]pm at
                 L2 increased in response to histamine. Under standard
                 patch conditions Ca2+ entry was negligible due to cell
                 depolarization. Using a physiological patch approach
                 (5.6 mM K+ in the bath), changes in [Ca2+]pm to
                 histamine could be monitored without cell
                 depolarization and, thus, in conditions where Ca2+
                 entry occurred. Here, histamine induced an initial
                 transient Ca2+ elevation to [&gt;=]3.5 {micro}M
                 followed by a long lasting plateau at ~1.2 {micro}M in
                 L1 and L3, whereas mitochondria kept neighboring
                 [Ca2+]pm low during stimulation. Thus, superficial
                 mitochondria and ER generate local domains of low and
                 high Ca2+ allowing simultaneous activation of BKCa and
                 CCE, despite their opposite Ca2+ sensitivity.",

                 that a dipole potential drop, positive in the
                 hydrophobic part of the membrane, arose due to the dye
                 adsorption. The dye adsorption led to a considerable

                 translocation through the membrane, but did not affect
                 their partition coefficient between membrane and water.
                 It implies that the region of the membrane where the
                 potential drops is located deeper than the adsorption
                 plane of hydrophobic ions. The values of boundary
                 potential differences were estimated by two independent
                 methods with unilateral and bilateral application of

                 electric field of dye dipole layer on an individual
                 dipole located in the same layer and on ion transport
                 through a membrane protein Na+/K+-ATPase. It turned out

                 decayed so rapidly that a neighbouring dye molecule did
                 not feel it. It also appeared that RH dyes could have

  abstract =     "We describe a method for determining intracellular
                 free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]) from
                 single-wavelength fluorescence signals. In contrast to
                 previous single-wavelength calibration methods, the
                 proposed method does not require independent estimates
                 of resting [Ca(2+)] but relies on the measurement of
                 fluorescence close to indicator saturation during an
                 experiment. Consequently, it is well suited to [Ca(2+)]
                 indicators for which saturation can be achieved under
                 physiological conditions. In addition, the method
                 requires that the indicators have large dynamic ranges.
                 Popular indicators such as Calcium Green-1 or Fluo-3
                 fulfill these conditions. As a test of the method, we
                 measured [Ca(2+)] in CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat
                 hippocampal slices using Oregon Green BAPTA-1 and
                 2-photon laser scanning microscopy (BAPTA:
                 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N', N'-tetraacetic
                 acid). Resting [Ca(2+)] was 32-59 nM in the proximal
                 apical dendrite. Monitoring action potential-evoked
                 [Ca(2+)] transients as a function of indicator loading
                 yielded estimates of endogenous buffering capacity
                 (44-80) and peak [Ca(2+)] changes at zero added buffer
                 (178-312 nM). In young animals (postnatal days 14-17)
                 our results were comparable to previous estimates
                 obtained by ratiometric methods (, Biophys. J.
                 70:1069-1081), and no significant differences were seen
                 in older animals (P24-28). We expect our method to be
                 widely applicable to measurements of [Ca(2+)] and
                 [Ca(2+)]-dependent processes in small neuronal
                 compartments, particularly in the many situations that
                 do not permit wavelength ratio imaging.",

                 development and dissipation of Ca(2+) gradients evoked
                 by the activation of voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels
                 in adrenal chromaffin cells. Ca(2+) gradients appeared
                 rapidly (<5 ms) upon membrane depolarization and
                 dissipated over several hundred milliseconds after
                 membrane repolarization. Dissipation occurred with an
                 initial fast phase, as the steep gradient near the
                 membrane collapsed, and a slower phase as the remaining
                 shallow gradient dispersed. Inhibition of active Ca(2+)
                 uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum (thapsigargin) and
                 mitochondria (carbonylcyanide
                 p-trifluoro-methoxyphenylhydrazone/oligomycin) had no
                 effect on the size of Ca(2+) changes or the rate of
                 gradient dissipation, suggesting that passive
                 endogenous Ca(2+) buffers are responsible for the slow
                 Ca(2+) redistribution. We used a radial diffusion model
                 incorporating Ca(2+) diffusion and binding to
                 intracellular Ca(2+) buffers to simulate Ca(2+)
                 gradients. We included a 3D optical sectioning model,
                 simulating the effects of out-of-focus light, to allow
                 comparison with the measured gradients. Introduction of
                 a high-capacity immobile Ca(2+) buffer, with a buffer
                 capacity on the order of 1000 and appropriate affinity
                 and kinetics, approximated the size of the Ca(2+)
                 increases and rate of dissipation of the measured
                 gradients. Finally, simulations without exogenous
                 buffer suggest that the Ca(2+) signal due to Ca(2+)
                 channel activation is restricted by the endogenous
                 buffer to a space less than 1 &mgr;m from the cell
                 membrane.",

                 performed in cell culture and acute brain slice
                 preparations, targeted recordings from the mammalian
                 nervous system are currently not possible in vivo. The
                 blind approach that is used instead is somewhat random
                 and largely limited to common neuronal cell types. This
                 approach prohibits recordings from, for example,
                 molecularly defined and/or disrupted populations of
                 neurons. Here we describe a method, which we call TPTP
                 (two-photon targeted patching), that uses two-photon
                 imaging to guide in vivo whole-cell recordings to
                 individual, genetically labeled cortical neurons. We
                 apply this technique to obtain recordings from
                 genetically manipulated, parvalbumin-EGFP-positive
                 interneurons in the somatosensory cortex. We find that
                 both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity patterns
                 involve the synchronized discharge of electrically
                 coupled interneurons. TPTP applied in vivo will

                 connectivity between its various components.
                 Three-dimensional reconstructions of the SER within
                 portions of Purkinje cell dendrites were performed from
                 serial sections through the cerebellar molecular layer.
                 In addition, semithick and thick sections (0.25-1
                 micron) of chick cerebellum in which the endomembrane
                 system had been selectively stained were examined with
                 an intermediate high-voltage electron microscope.
                 Three-dimensional information was extracted from thick
                 sections using stereo pairs and tomographic
                 reconstructions from single axis tilt series. In
                 contrast to its discontinuous appearance in thin

                 tubules and cisterns extending throughout the dendritic
                 shaft and into the spines. Several distinct

                 properties of europium ion complexed to a fluorescent
                 chelating group capable of labeling proteins are
                 exploited to provide high contrast images of biotin
                 labeled ligands through detection of the delayed
                 emission. The streptavidin-based macromolecular complex
                 (SBMC) employs streptavidin cross-linked to
                 thyroglobulin multiply labeled with the
                 europium-fluorescent chelate. The fluorescent chelate
                 is efficiently excited with 340-nm light, after which
                 it sensitizes europium ion emission at 612 nm hundreds
                 of microseconds later. The SBMC complex has a high
                 quantum yield orders of magnitude higher than that of
                 eosin, a commonly used delayed luminescent probe, and
                 can be readily seen by the naked eye, even in specimens
                 double-labeled with prompt fluorescent probes. Unlike
                 triplet-state phosphorescent probes, sensitized
                 europium ion emission is insensitive to photobleaching
                 and quenching by molecular oxygen; these properties
                 have been exploited to obtain delayed luminescence
                 images of living cells in aerated medium thus
                 complementing imaging studies using prompt fluorescent
                 probes. Since TR-DLIM has the unique property of
                 rejecting enormous signals that originate from
                 scattered light, autofluorescence, and prompt
                 fluorescence it has been possible to resolve double
                 emission images of living amoeba cells containing an
                 intensely stained lucifer yellow in pinocytosed
                 vesicles and membrane surface-bound SBMC-labeled

                 represented in terms of the time decay of the
                 sensitized emission show the lifetime of the europium

                 can activate either large- (BK) or small- (SK)
                 conductance calcium-activated potassium channels. In
                 hippocampal neurons, activation of BK channels
                 underlies the falling phase of an action potential and
                 generation of the fast afterhyperpolarization (AHP). In
                 contrast, SK channel activation underlies generation of
                 the slow AHP after a burst of action potentials. The
                 source of calcium for BK channel activation is unknown,
                 but the slow AHP is blocked by dihydropyridine
                 antagonists, indicating that L-type calcium channels
                 provide the calcium for activation of SK channels. It
                 is not understood how this specialized coupling between
                 calcium and potassium channels is achieved. Here we
                 study channel activity in cell-attached patches from
                 hippocampal neurons and report a unique specificity of
                 coupling. L-type channels activate SK channels only,
                 without activating BK channels present in the same
                 patch. The delay between the opening of L-type channels
                 and SK channels indicates that these channels are
                 50-150 nm apart. In contrast, N-type calcium channels
                 activate BK channels only, with opening of the two
                 channel types being nearly coincident. This temporal
                 association indicates that N and BK channels are very
                 close. Finally, P/Q-type calcium channels do not couple
                 to either SK or BK channels. These data indicate an
                 absolute segregation of coupling between channels, and
                 illustrate the functional importance of submembrane

                 mobilization in cerebellar granule cells at 9 days in
                 vitro; and studied the Ca(2+) modulation of the PLC
                 response. Both PLC activation and Ca(2+) signalling
                 were found to be mediated exclusively by the mGluR1
                 subtype, although both group I mGluRs, mGluR1 alpha and
                 mGluR5, could be detected in cell extracts. Exposure of
                 cells to medium devoid of Ca(2+) for various times
                 before agonist stimulation reduced the PLC response,
                 which was quickly recovered following the re-exposure
                 of cells to Ca(2+)-containing medium. The extent of the
                 glutamate response correlated well with changes in the
                 cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration. On the other hand,
                 loading of the intracellular Ca(2+) stores by a
                 transient depolarization followed by washing in
                 nondepolarizing buffer, allowed glutamate to release
                 stored Ca(2+) in the majority of cells and enhanced
                 glutamate activation of PLC. Under such conditions, the
                 absence of extracellular Ca(2+) during stimulation and
                 the chelation of cytosolic Ca(2+) with BAPTA/AM
                 inhibited both glutamate-elicited Ca(2+) response and
                 PLC activation. Overall, these results indicate that
                 the mGluR-mediated activation of PLC depends on the
                 presence of extracellular Ca(2+) and can be modulated
                 by moderate changes of cytosolic Ca(2+). Furthermore,
                 ryanodine reduced PLC stimulation by glutamate in
                 predepolarized cells but not in control cells,
                 suggesting that ryanodine receptors could play a role

                 mitochondria was studied by following the swelling
                 consequent to external solute equilibration through the
                 membrane pore. The kinetics of the transition was
                 analyzed according to a model based on the assumptions
                 that the transition rate follows a first-order process
                 and that the solute diffusion rate strongly depends on
                 the pore conformation. Three kinetic parameters, easily
                 calculated from absorbance measurements during
                 mitochondrial swelling, were used to determine whether
                 changes of the swelling rate are due to changes of (i)
                 the transition rate, (ii) the amount of permeabilized
                 mitochondria, (iii) the mean pore dimension, or (iv)
                 the number of pores per mitochondrion. The model was
                 tested for transitions induced either by phenylarsine
                 oxide (PhAsO) or by Ca2+ and Pi. Under both conditions,
                 only a definite fraction of mitochondria was
                 permeabilized, and the transition always followed a
                 first-order reaction, indicating that mitochondria
                 behaved as a homogeneous population. However, the
                 equilibration of external solutes was rapid only in a
                 fraction of permeabilized mitochondria and slow in the
                 remaining fraction, due to restricted solute diffusion
                 through narrower pores. With 0.2 mM PhAsO as the
                 inducer, the fraction of permeabilized mitochondria was
                 about 0.8. Sucrose diffusion was rapid only in 15\% of
                 this fraction (half-time less than 1 s) and restricted
                 in the remaining 85\% (half-time of about 60 s).
                 Increasing PhAsO concentrations increased the number of
                 pores per mitochondrion and the rate constant of the
                 permeability transition, but not the mean pore diameter
                 and the fraction of permeabilized mitochondria. With
                 0.28 mgr;M free [Ca2+] and 1 mM Pi as the inducers,
                 the fraction of permeabilized mitochondria was about
                 0.43. Sucrose diffusion was rapid in 60\% of this
                 fraction and restricted in the remaining 40\%
                 (half-time of about 9 s). The permeabilization process
                 started above a threshold- free [Ca2+] of 0.15 microM,
                 and the rate constant and the fraction of permeabilized
                 mitochondria reached a maximum at about 0.2 microM,

                 domain or inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI)
                 3-kinase. An array of domains specific for PLCgamma

  abstract =     "Cell motility, a primary component of tumor cell
                 invasion, is a continuum of sequential events in which
                 the cell extends pseudopodia, forms nascent
                 attachments, assembles and contracts the cytoskeleton,
                 and finally, as it translocates forward, disengages
                 distal adhesions. What triggers cells to move?
                 Substratum contact mediated by integrin adhesion
                 receptors is important, but other signals such as
                 chemokinetic factors appear to be required for
                 continued crawling. It is now apparent that integrins
                 do not simply bind cells to matrix in a Velcro-like
                 fashion, but also are potent signaling molecules.
                 Initial engagement of integrins induces their
                 condensation into focal contacts, forming anchors to
                 the extracellular matrix and discrete
                 signal-transducing complexes on the cytoplasmic
                 surface. A number of growth factors, through either
                 autocrine or paracrine pathways, can activate the
                 cellular machinery that mobilizes the cell. Thus, these
                 two classes of receptors--the integrin receptors that
                 bind specific extracellular adhesion molecules, and
                 growth factor receptors that bind their respective
                 ligands--can regulate cell locomotion. Not
                 surprisingly, there is 'cross-talk' between integrin
                 and growth factor receptors that occurs through their
                 common intracellular signaling pathways. In this way,
                 each receptor type can either amplify or attenuate the
                 other's signal and downstream response. An example of
                 growth factor-induced motility is the
                 epithelial-mesenchymal transition induced by hepatocyte
                 growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF). When bound to
                 its receptor, the c-met proto-oncogene product, HGF/SF
                 induces a phenotypic conversion that appears to be an
                 important aspect of tumor progression in malignant
                 carcinomas. The motogenic response produced by HGF/SF
                 in carcinoma cells occurs in discrete steps in which
                 integrins and focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) are first
                 recruited to focal contacts. This is rapidly followed
                 by cell spreading, disruption of focal adhesions and
                 cell-cell contacts, and, finally, cell crawling. The
                 precise mechanism by which growth factors such as
                 HGF/SF and its receptor induce this motogenic response

                 controlled pathways, the protein product encoded by one

                 time delay, after activation of the first promoter, to
                 reach an effective level to control the next promoter
                 depends on the rate of protein accumulation. We have
                 analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript
                 initiation and translation termination in a single such
                 genetically coupled link as a precursor to modeling

                 of variable numbers of proteins that occur at random

                 concentration ([Ca2+]c) in guinea-pig single colonic
                 myocytes has been examined, using whole-cell recording,
                 flash photolysis of caged InsP3 and microfluorimetry.
                 2. Depolarization increased [Ca2+]c and triggered
                 contraction. Resting [Ca2+]c was virtually restored
                 some 4 s after the end of depolarization, a time when
                 the muscle had shortened to 50 \% of its fully relaxed
                 length. The muscle then slowly relaxed (t = 17 s). 3.
                 The decline in the Ca2+ transient was monophasic but
                 often undershot or overshot resting levels, depending
                 on resting [Ca2+]c. The extent of the overshoot or
                 undershoot increased with increasing peak [Ca2+]c. 4.
                 Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP; 5
                 microM), which dissipates the mitochondrial proton
                 electrochemical gradient and therefore prevents
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation, slowed Ca2+ removal at
                 high ( > 300 nM) but not at lower [Ca2+]c and abolished
                 [Ca2+]c overshoots. Oligomycin B (5 microM), which
                 prevents mitchondrial ATP production, affected neither
                 the rate of decline nor the magnitude of the overshoot.
                 5. During depolarization, the global rhod-2 signal
                 (which represents the mitochondrial matrix Ca2+
                 concentration, [Ca2+]m) rose slowly in a CCCP-sensitive
                 manner during and for about 3 s after depolarization
                 had ended. [Ca2+]m then slowly decreased over tens of
                 seconds. 6. Inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+
                 uptake with thapsigargin (100 nM) reduced the
                 undershoot and increased the overshoot. 7. Flash
                 photolysis of caged InsP3 (20 microM) evoked
                 reproducible increases in [Ca2+]c. CCCP (5 microM)
                 reduced the magnitude of the [Ca2+]c transients evoked
                 by flash photolysis of caged InsP3. Oligomycin B (5
                 microM) did not reduce the inhibition of the
                 InsP3-induced Ca2+ transient by CCCP thus minimizing
                 the possibility that CCCP lowered ATP levels by
                 reversing the mitochondrial ATP synthase and so
                 reducing SR Ca2+ refilling. 8. While CCCP reduced the

  abstract =     "In many neurons, Ca(2+) signaling depends on efflux of
                 Ca(2+) from intracellular stores into the cytoplasm via
                 caffeine-sensitive ryanodine receptors (RyRs) of the
                 endoplasmic reticulum. We have used high-speed confocal
                 microscopy to image depolarization- and caffeine-evoked
                 increases in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels in individual
                 cultured frog sympathetic neurons. Although
                 caffeine-evoked Ca(2+) wave fronts propagated
                 throughout the cell, in most cells the initial Ca(2+)
                 release was from one or more discrete sites that were
                 several micrometers wide and located at the cell edge,
                 even in Ca(2+)-free external solution. During cell-wide
                 cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)] oscillations triggered by
                 continual caffeine application, the initial Ca(2+)
                 release that began each Ca(2+) peak was from the same
                 subcellular site or sites. The Ca(2+) wave fronts
                 propagated with constant amplitude; the spread was
                 mostly via calcium-induced calcium release. Propagation
                 was faster around the cell periphery than radially
                 inward. Local Ca(2+) levels within the cell body could
                 increase or decrease independently of neighboring
                 regions, suggesting independent action of spatially
                 separate Ca(2+) stores. Confocal imaging of fluorescent
                 analogs of ryanodine and thapsigargin, and of
                 MitoTracker, showed potential structural correlates to
                 the patterns of Ca(2+) release and propagation. High
                 densities of RyRs were found in a ring around the cell
                 periphery, mitochondria in a broader ring just inside
                 the RyRs, and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase
                 pumps in hot spots at the cell edge. Discrete sites at
                 the cell edge primed to release Ca(2+) from
                 intracellular stores might preferentially convert
                 Ca(2+) influx through a local area of plasma membrane
                 into a cell-wide Ca(2+) increase.",

                 changes in tissue metabolites and generate signals that
                 are communicated upstream to resistance vessels. The
                 mechanism for this communication may involve changes in
                 capillary endothelial cell membrane potentials which
                 are then conducted to upstream arterioles. We have
                 tested the capacity of capillary endothelial cells in
                 vivo to respond to pharmacological stimuli. In a
                 hamster cheek pouch preparation, capillary endothelial
                 cells were labeled with the voltage-sensitive dye
                 di-8-ANEPPS. Fluorescence from capillary segments
                 (75-150 microns long) was excited at 475 nm and
                 recorded at 560 and 620 nm with a dual-wavelength
                 photomultiplier system. KCl was applied using pressure
                 injection, and acetylcholine (ACh) and phenylephrine
                 (PE) were applied iontophoretically to these
                 capillaries. Changes in the ratio of the fluorescence
                 emission at two emission wavelengths were used to
                 estimate changes in the capillary endothelial membrane
                 potential. Application of KCl resulted in
                 depolarization, whereas application of the vehicle did
                 not. Application of ACh and PE resulted in
                 hyperpolarization and depolarization, respectively. The
                 capillary responses could be blocked by including a
                 receptor antagonist (atropine or prazosin,
                 respectively) in the superfusate. We conclude that the
                 capillary membrane potential is capable of responding
                 to pharmacological stimuli. We hypothesize that
                 capillaries can respond to changes in the milieu of
                 surrounding tissue via changes in endothelial membrane

                 domains of known structure and its nonspecific
                 electrostatic sequestration by unstructured domains.
                 Several investigators have postulated the existence of
                 distinct pools of PIP2 within the cell to account for
                 the myriad functions of this lipid. Recent experimental

                 of cellular function. To accommodate so many control
                 functions, a complex spatiotemporal organization of
                 calcium signaling has developed. In both excitable and
                 nonexcitable cells, calcium signaling was found to
                 fluctuate. Sudden localized increases in the
                 intracellular calcium concentration-or calcium
                 sparks-were found in heart, striated and smooth muscle,
                 Xenopus Laevis oocytes, and HeLa and P12 cells. In the
                 nervous system, intracellular calcium ions were found
                 important in key processes such as transmitter release,
                 repetitive firing, and gene expression. Hence, we
                 examined whether calcium sparks also exist in neurons.
                 Using confocal laser-scanning microscopy and
                 fluorescent probes, we found that calcium sparks exist
                 in two types of neuronal preparations: the presynaptic
                 boutons of the lizard neuromuscular junction and rat
                 hippocampal neurons in cell culture. Control
                 experiments exclude the possibility that these calcium
                 sparks originate from instrumental or biological
                 artifacts. Calcium sparks seem to be just the tip of
                 the iceberg of a more general phenomenon of
                 intracellular calcium noise. We speculate that calcium
                 sparks and calcium noise may be of key importance in
                 calcium signaling in the nervous system.",

  abstract =     "MOTIVATION: The simulation of biochemical kinetic
                 systems is a powerful approach that can be used for:
                 (i) checking the consistency of a postulated model with
                 a set of experimental measurements, (ii) answering
                 'what if?' questions and (iii) exploring possible
                 behaviours of a model. Here we describe a generic
                 approach to combine numerical optimization methods with
                 biochemical kinetic simulations, which is suitable for
                 use in the rational design of improved metabolic
                 pathways with industrial significance (metabolic
                 engineering) and for solving the inverse problem of
                 metabolic pathways, i.e. the estimation of parameters
                 from measured variables. RESULTS: We discuss the
                 suitability of various optimization methods, focusing
                 especially on their ability or otherwise to find global
                 optima. We recommend that a suite of diverse
                 optimization methods should be available in simulation
                 software as no single one performs best for all
                 problems. We describe how we have implemented such a
                 simulation-optimization strategy in the biochemical
                 kinetics simulator Gepasi and present examples of its
                 application. AVAILABILITY: The new version of Gepasi

                 We show that a previously described Purkinje-cell

                 potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD) of the

                 experiments testing how LTP and LTD depend on the
                 conditioning input are carried out with trains of
                 stimuli at constant frequencies, whereas neurons in
                 vivo most likely experience a stochastic variation of
                 interstimulus intervals. We used a computational model
                 of synaptic transmission to test if and to what extent
                 the stochastic fluctuations of an input signal could
                 alter the probability to change the state of a synapse.
                 We found that, even if the mean stimulation frequency
                 was maintained constant, the probability to induce LTD
                 and LTP could be a function of the temporal variation
                 of the input activity. This mechanism, which depends
                 only on the statistical properties of the input and not

                 have an important role to determine the amount of
                 LTP/LTD induction in vivo. In response to a change in
                 the distribution of the interstimulus intervals, as
                 measured by the coefficient of variation, a synapse
                 could be easily adapted to inputs that might require
                 immediate attention, with a shift of the input
                 thresholds required to elicit LTD or LTP, which are
                 restored to their initial conditions as soon as the

                 relatively short periods in nonmotile or stationary
                 cells in culture. By using the antioxidant, Oxyrase, we
                 have reduced the sensitivity of fluorescent MTs to
                 photodamage and this has allowed us to image
                 fluorescent MTs with good temporal resolution over much
                 longer periods of time. We have used our enhanced
                 imaging capabilities to examine MT dynamics in
                 fibroblasts moving directionally into a wound. We found
                 that MTs in these cells exhibited dynamic instability
                 similar to that reported for other cells. More
                 interestingly, we found a novel dynamic behavior of the
                 MTs in which entire MTs were moved inward from the
                 leading edge toward the cell nucleus. This centripetal
                 transport (CT) of MTs only occurred to those MTs that
                 were oriented with their long axis parallel to the
                 leading edge; radially oriented MTs were not
                 transported centripetally. Both small bundles of MTs
                 and individual MTs were observed to undergo CT at a
                 rate of 0.63 +/-0.37 micron/min. This rate was similar
                 to the rate of CT of latex beads applied to the cell
                 surface and of endogenous pinocytotic vesicles in the
                 cytoplasm. When we imaged both MTs and pinocytotic
                 vesicles, we found that the pinocytotic vesicles were
                 ensheathed by a small group of parallel MTs that moved
                 centripetally in concert with the vesicles. Conversely,
                 we found many instances of MTs moving centripetally
                 without associated vesicles. When cells were treated
                 with nocodazole to depolymerize MTs rapidly, the rate
                 of pinocytotic vesicle CT was inhibited by 75\%. This
                 suggests that centripetal transport of MTs may be
                 involved in the movement of pinocytotic vesicles in
                 cells. In conclusion, our results show that MTs in
                 motile cells are redistributed by a novel mechanism,
                 CT, that does not require changes in polymer length.
                 The centripetally transported MTs may play a role in
                 transporting pinocytotic vesicles in the cell.",

                 spatial distribution of several antigens involved in
                 calcium (Ca)-dependent processes: the intracellular Ca
                 receptors, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1
                 (IP3R1) and ryanodine receptor (RyR); the Ca-binding
                 proteins, calbindin D-28k (CB), parvalbumin (PV), and
                 synaptophysin; and phosphorylated (SMI 31) and
                 nonphosphorylated (SMI 32) forms of neurofilament
                 protein. All antigens were studied in the human
                 cerebellum during intrauterine development. The results
                 of this study show that immunocytochemical markers
                 appeared in the following sequence: CB and both forms
                 ofneurofilament protein were observed at 4-5
                 gestational weeks (g.w.), PV appeared in the external
                 granular layer and in a few Purkinje cells at 11 g.w.,
                 a diffuse immunostaining for IP3R1 and synaptophysin
                 were observed at 13 g.w., whereas RyR was observed at
                 17-18 g.w. From 24 g.w. on, Purkinje cells expressed
                 all four examined markers of intracellular Ca signaling
                 as well as two forms of neurofilament protein. At the
                 same time, compartmentation of the Purkinje cell layer
                 was detected with three intracellular Ca-signaling
                 molecules (IP3R1, CB, and PV) and with SMI 32. These
                 results indicate that the developmentally regulated
                 expression of antigens studied here may play a role in
                 establishing a highly regular organization of terminal
                 fields in the human cerebellar cortex. Moreover, the

                 from intracellular stores by binding to its receptor
                 (IP(3)R), a multigene family of Ca(2+)-release channels
                 consisting of IP(3)R1, IP(3)R2, and IP(3)R3. IP(3)R1 is
                 stimulated by low cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentrations and
                 inhibited by high concentrations. Discrepant reports
                 appeared about the effect of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) on
                 IP(3)R3, showing either a bell-shaped dependence or
                 only a stimulatory phase with no negative feedback by
                 high Ca(2+) concentrations. We investigated how
                 calmodulin interfered with the feedback of cytosolic
                 Ca(2+) on the unidirectional IP(3)-induced Ca(2+)
                 release in permeabilized 16HBE14o- bronchial mucosal
                 cells, where IP(3)R3 represents 93\% of the receptors
                 at the mRNA level and 81\% at the protein level.
                 Calmodulin inhibited the Ca(2+) release induced by 1.5
                 microM IP(3) with an IC(50) value of 9 microM. This
                 inhibition was absolutely dependent on the presence of
                 cytosolic Ca(2+). Ca(2+) inhibited the IP(3)R with an
                 IC(50) value of 0.92 microM Ca(2+) in the absence of
                 calmodulin and with an IC(50) value of 0.15 microM
                 Ca(2+) in its presence. It is concluded that: 1)
                 IP(3)R3 can be inhibited by calmodulin, 2) IP(3)R3 is
                 inhibited by high Ca(2+) concentrations, and 3)
                 calmodulin shifts the inhibitory part of the
                 Ca(2+)-response curve toward lower Ca(2+)

                 binding to the IP3 receptor in both a Ca2+-dependent

                 functional data on the modulation of the IP3-induced
                 Ca2+ release by calmodulin at various Ca2+
                 concentrations, we have studied how cytosolic Ca2+ and

                 IP3-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized A7r5 cells.
                 We now report that calmodulin inhibited Ca2+ release
                 through the IP3 receptor with an IC50 of 4.6 microM if
                 the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was 0.3 microM or
                 higher. This inhibition was particularly pronounced at
                 low IP3 concentrations. In contrast, calmodulin did not
                 affect IP3-induced Ca2+ release if the cytosolic Ca2+

                 inhibited Ca2+ release through the IP3 receptor in the
                 presence of at least 10 microM Sr2+. We conclude that
                 cytosolic Ca2+ or Sr2+ are absolutely required for the
                 calmodulin-induced inhibition of the IP3-induced Ca2+
                 release and that this dependence represents the

                 release from intracellular stores via the inositol

                 both IP(3) and Ca(2+) for its activity. Due to the
                 Ca(2+) requirement, the IP(3)R and the cytoplasmic
                 Ca(2+) concentration form a positive feedback loop,
                 which has been assumed to confer regenerativity on the
                 IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) release and to play an important
                 role in the generation of spatiotemporal patterns of
                 Ca(2+) signals such as Ca(2+) waves and oscillations.
                 Here we show that glutamate 2100 of rat type 1 IP(3)R
                 (IP(3)R1) is a key residue for the Ca(2+) requirement.
                 Substitution of this residue by aspartate (E2100D)
                 results in a 10-fold decrease in the Ca(2+) sensitivity
                 without other effects on the properties of the IP(3)R1.
                 Agonist-induced Ca(2+) responses are greatly diminished
                 in cells expressing the E2100D mutant IP(3)R1,
                 particularly the rate of rise of initial Ca(2+) spike
                 is markedly reduced and the subsequent Ca(2+)
                 oscillations are abolished. These results demonstrate
                 that the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the IP(3)R is

                 Ca(2+) signaling patterns.",

                 are often extremely localized and hard to measure. To
                 overcome this problem we have constructed new
                 fluorescent indicators for Ca2+ that are genetically
                 encoded without cofactors and are targetable to
                 specific intracellular locations. We have dubbed these
                 fluorescent indicators 'cameleons'. They consist of
                 tandem fusions of a blue- or cyan-emitting mutant of
                 the green fluorescent protein (GFP), calmodulin, the
                 calmodulin-binding peptide M13, and an enhanced green-
                 or yellow-emitting GFP. Binding of Ca2+ makes
                 calmodulin wrap around the M13 domain, increasing the
                 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between
                 the flanking GFPs. Calmodulin mutations can tune the
                 Ca2+ affinities to measure free Ca2+ concentrations in
                 the range 10(-8) to 10(-2) M. We have visualized free
                 Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol, nucleus and endoplasmic

                 complementary DNAs encoding chimaeras bearing

                 the endoplasmic reticulum of individual cells ranged
                 from 60 to 400 microM at rest, and 1 to 50 microM after
                 Ca2+ mobilization. FRET is also an indicator of the
                 reversible intermolecular association of
                 cyan-GFP-labelled calmodulin with yellow-GFP-labelled
                 M13. Thus FRET between GFP mutants can monitor

                 targeted genetically and imaged by one- or two-photon
                 excitation microscopy, they offer great promise for
                 monitoring Ca2+ in whole organisms, tissues,
                 organelles, and submicroscopic environments in which
                 measurements were previously impossible. However, the
                 original cameleons suffered from significant pH
                 interference, and their Ca2+-buffering and
                 cross-reactivity with endogenous CaM signaling pathways
                 was uncharacterized. We have now greatly reduced the

                 mutations V68L and Q69K into the acceptor yellow green

                 predominantly interact with each other rather than with

                 largely of collagen, myosin, and tubulin, and their
                 associated proteins can be imaged in three dimensions
                 with high contrast and resolution by laser-scanning
                 second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. SHG is a
                 nonlinear optical scheme and this form of microscopy
                 shares several common advantages with multiphoton
                 excited fluorescence, namely, intrinsic
                 three-dimensionality and reduced out-of-plane
                 photobleaching and phototoxicity. SHG does not arise
                 from absorption and in-plane photodamage considerations
                 are therefore also greatly reduced. In particular,
                 structural protein arrays that are highly ordered and
                 birefringent produce large SHG signals without the need
                 for any exogenous labels. We demonstrate that thick
                 tissues including muscle and bone can be imaged and
                 sectioned through several hundred micrometers of depth.
                 Combining SHG with two-photon excited green fluorescent
                 protein (GFP) imaging allows inference of the molecular
                 origin of the SHG contrast in Caenorhabditis elegans
                 sarcomeres. Symmetry and organization of microtubule
                 structures in dividing C. elegans embryos are similarly
                 studied by comparing the endogenous tubulin contrast
                 with that of GFP::tubulin fluorescence. It is found
                 that SHG provides molecular level data on radial and
                 lateral symmetries that GFP constructs cannot. The
                 physical basis of SHG is discussed and compared with
                 that of two-photon excitation as well as that of
                 polarization microscopy. Due to the intrinsic
                 sectioning, lack of photobleaching, and availability of
                 molecular level data, SHG is a powerful tool for in
                 vivo imaging.",

                 increases in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that

                 cell stimulation. The present study focuses on the
                 pathways for mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux. Treatment
                 with protonophores before cell stimulation abolished
                 mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake and increased the cytosolic
                 [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](c)) peak induced by the stimulus.
                 Instead, when protonophores were added after cell
                 stimulation, they did not modify [Ca(2+)](c) kinetics
                 and inhibited Ca(2+) release from Ca(2+)-loaded
                 mitochondria. This effect was due to inhibition of
                 mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, because blocking
                 this system with CGP37157 produced no further effect.
                 Increasing extramitochondrial [Ca(2+)](c) triggered
                 fast Ca(2+) release from these depolarized
                 Ca(2+)-loaded mitochondria, both in intact or
                 permeabilized cells. These effects of protonophores
                 were mimicked by valinomycin, but not by nigericin. The
                 observed mitochondrial Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release

                 but fully blocked by ruthenium red, suggesting that it
                 may be mediated by reversal of the Ca(2+) uniporter.
                 This novel kind of mitochondrial Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)
                 release might contribute to Ca(2+) clearance from

                 steady-state [Ca2+] in the ER was around 600 microM.
                 Histamine induced a concentration-dependent decrease in

                 magnitude and became quantal when cytosolic [Ca2+]

                 This effect was not due to decreased Ca2+ pumping
                 because simultaneous addition of a SERCA inhibitor
                 produced only additive effects. Given that inhibition
                 by [Ca2+]c of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-gated

                 connection of mitochondria with the apoptotic death
                 cascade. The goal is to highlight the regulatory role
                 of mitochondrial channels on the mitochondrial membrane
                 potential, Deltapsi, and their involvement in
                 determining neuronal survival or death. A hypothesis is
                 developed centered on the notion that protein-protein
                 interactions between members of the Bcl-2 family of
                 death suppressor and promoter proteins lead to the
                 selective elimination of depolarizing currents that, in
                 turn, collapse Deltapsi and set in motion the
                 irreversible pathway of cell death. The model considers
                 the remarkable propensity of Bcl-2 family proteins to
                 dimerize or oligomerize and thereby restrict the
                 localization of partner molecules to mitochondrial
                 membrane contact sites. The fundamental principle
                 invoked here is that through a concerted set of
                 protein-protein interactions, information is exchanged
                 by specific heterodimers, one of the partners acting as
                 a toxic protein and the second as its antidote. The
                 review concludes with the elaboration of a speculative
                 model about cellular mechanisms for the prevention of
                 cell destruction as triggered by extracellular signals
                 which may be conserved in its molecular design from
                 bacteria to eukaryotes. [References: 117]",

                 imaging to evaluate changes in the matrix free Ca2+
                 concentration of individual mitochondria ([Ca2+]m) in
                 agonist-stimulated, primary cultured aortic myocytes.
                 Stimulation with 10 microM serotonin (5-HT) evoked
                 modest cytosolic Ca2+ transients [cytosolic free Ca2+
                 concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) <500 nM; measured with fura
                 2] and triggered contractions in short-term cultured
                 myocytes. However, 5-HT triggered a large mitochondrial
                 rhod 2 signal (indicating pronounced elevation of
                 [Ca2+]m) in only 4\% of cells. This revealed
                 heterogeneity in the responses of individual
                 mitochondria, all of which stained with MitoTracker
                 Green FM. In contrast, stimulation with 100 microM ATP
                 evoked large cytosolic Ca2+ transients (>1,000 nM) and
                 induced pronounced, reversible elevation of [Ca2+]m
                 (measured as rhod 2 fluorescence) in 60\% of cells.
                 This mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake usually lagged behind
                 the cytosolic Ca2+ transient peak by 3-5 s, and [Ca2+]m
                 declined more slowly than did bulk [Ca2+]cyt. The
                 uptake delay may prevent mitochondria from interfering
                 with rapid signaling events while enhancing the
                 mitochondrial response to large, long-duration
                 elevations of [Ca2+]cyt. The responses of arterial
                 myocytes to modest physiological stimulation do not,
                 however, depend on such marked changes in [Ca2+]m.",

                 predict the fluctuations in numbers of molecules in a
                 chemotactic signalling pathway of coliform bacteria.
                 Specifically, we examined temporal changes in molecules
                 of CheYp, a cytoplasmic protein known to influence the
                 direction of rotation of the flagellar motor.
                 Signalling molecules in the vicinity of a flagellar
                 motor were represented as individual software objects
                 interacting according to probabilities derived from
                 experimentally-observed concentrations rate constants.
                 The simulated CheYp molecules were found to undergo
                 random fluctuations in number about an average
                 corresponding to the deterministically calculated
                 concentration. Both the relative amplitude of the
                 fluctuations, as a proportion of the total number of
                 molecules, and their average duration, increased as the
                 simulated volume was reduced. In a simulation
                 corresponding to 10\% of the volume of a bacterium, the
                 average duration of fluctuations was found to be 80.7
                 ms, which is much shorter than the observed
                 alternations between clockwise and counter clockwise
                 rotations of tethered bacteria (typically 2.6 s). Our
                 results are therefore not in agreement with a simple
                 threshold-crossing model for motor switching. However,
                 it is possible to filter the CheYp fluctuations to
                 produce temporal distributions closer to the observed
                 swimming behaviour and we discuss the possible
                 implications for the control of motor rotation.",

                 (InsP3)-gated Ca channel, resulting in a bell-shaped Ca
                 dependence of channel activity (Bezprozvanny, I., J.

                 95:1103-1122). The ability of Ca to inhibit channel
                 activity, however, varies dramatically depending on
                 InsP3 concentration (Combettes, L., Z. Hannaert-Merah,
                 J.F. Coquil, C. Rousseau, M. Claret, S. Swillens, and
                 P. Champeil. 1994. J. Biol. Chem. 269:17561-17571;

                 Gen. Physiol. 110:529-538). In the present report, we
                 have extended the characterization of the effect of
                 cytosolic Ca on both InsP3 binding and InsP3-gated
                 channel kinetics, and incorporated these data into a
                 mathematical model capable of simulating channel
                 kinetics. We found that cytosolic Ca increased the Kd
                 of InsP3 binding approximately 3.5-fold, but did not
                 influence the maximal number of binding sites. The
                 ability of Ca to decrease InsP3 binding is consistent
                 with the rightward shift in the bell-shaped Ca
                 dependence of InsP3-gated Ca channel activity. High
                 InsP3 concentrations are able to overcome the
                 Ca-dependent inhibition of channel activity, apparently
                 due to a low affinity InsP3 binding site (Kaftan, E.J.,
                 B.E. Ehrlich, and J. Watras. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol.
                 110:529-538). Constants from binding analyses and
                 channel activity determinations were used to develop a
                 mathematical model that fits the complex Ca-dependent
                 regulation of the type 1 InsP3-gated Ca channel. This
                 model accurately simulated both steady state data
                 (channel open probability and InsP3 binding) and
                 kinetic data (channel activity and open time
                 distributions), and yielded testable predictions with
                 regard to the regulation of this intracellular Ca
                 channel. Information gained from these analyses, and
                 our current molecular model of this Ca channel, will be
                 important for understanding the basis and regulation of
                 intracellular Ca waves and oscillations in intact

                 methylation at different sites, binding of CheB, CheR
                 and CheY) are represented as binary flags, and each
                 combination of flags confers a different free energy to
                 the two conformations. Binding and catalysis by the
                 complex are performed stochastically according to the
                 complete set of known reactions allowing the swimming
                 performance of the bacterium to be predicted.The
                 assumption of two conformational states together with
                 the use of free energy values allows us to bring
                 together seemingly unrelated experimental parameters.
                 Because of thermodynamic constraints, we find that the
                 binding affinity for aspartate is linked to changes in
                 phosphorylation activity. We estimate the pattern of
                 Tar methylation and effective affinity constant of
                 receptors over a range of aspartate levels. We also
                 obtain evidence that both the methylating and
                 demethylating enzymes must operate exclusively on one
                 or other of the two conformations, and that sites of
                 methylation of the complex are occupied in sequential
                 order rather than independently. Detailed analysis of
                 the response to aspartate reveals several quantitative
                 discrepancies between simulated and experimental data
                 which indicate areas for future research. Copyright

                 specific regions of infected cells. Here we show that
                 the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome
                 contains two sequences similar to the hnRNP A2 response
                 element (A2RE), a cis-acting RNA trafficking sequence
                 that binds to the trans-acting trafficking factor,
                 hnRNP A2, and mediates a specific RNA trafficking
                 pathway characterized extensively in oligodendrocytes.
                 The two HIV-1 sequences, designated A2RE-1, within the
                 major homology region of the gag gene, and A2RE-2, in a
                 region of overlap between the vpr and tat genes, both
                 bind to hnRNP A2 in vitro and are necessary and
                 sufficient for RNA transport in oligodendrocytes in
                 vivo. A single base change (A8G) in either sequence
                 reduces hnRNP A2 binding and, in the case of A2RE-2,
                 inhibits RNA transport. A2RE-mediated RNA transport is
                 microtubule and hnRNP A2 dependent. Differentially
                 labelled gag and vpr RNAs, containing A2RE-1 and
                 A2RE-2, respectively, coassemble into the same RNA
                 trafficking granules and are cotransported to the
                 periphery of the cell. tat RNA, although it contains
                 A2RE-2, is not transported as efficiently as vpr RNA.
                 An A2RE/hnRNP A2-mediated trafficking pathway for HIV
                 RNA is proposed, and the role of RNA trafficking in
                 targeting HIV gene expression is discussed.",

                 strength at central synapses. Despite intensive study

                 accumulation caused by unitary events at individual

                 receptor-mediated miniature synaptic calcium transients
                 (MSCTs) caused by spontaneous release of synaptic
                 vesicles in dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons.
                 MSCTs originated focally in dendritic regions <1 &mgr;m

                 intracellular Ca2+. Considering that Bcl-2 is partially
                 localized to mitochondrial membranes and that excessive
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake can impair electron transport
                 and oxidative phosphorylation, the present study tested
                 the hypothesis that mitochondria from Bcl-2-expressing
                 cells have a higher capacity for energy-dependent Ca2+
                 uptake and a greater resistance to Ca(2+)-induced
                 respiratory injury than mitochondria from cells that do
                 not express this protein. The overexpression of bcl-2
                 enhanced the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake capacity using
                 either digitonin-permeabilized GT1-7 neural cells or
                 isolated GT1-7 mitochondria by 1.7 and 3.9 fold,
                 respectively, when glutamate and malate were used as
                 respiratory substrates. This difference was less
                 apparent when respiration was driven by the oxidation
                 of succinate in the presence of the respiratory complex
                 I inhibitor rotenone. Mitochondria from Bcl-2
                 expressors were also much more resistant to inhibition
                 of NADH-dependent respiration caused by sequestration
                 of large Ca2+ loads. The enhanced ability of
                 mitochondria within Bcl-2-expressing cells to sequester
                 large quantities of Ca2+ without undergoing profound
                 respiratory impairment provides a plausible mechanism
                 by which Bcl-2 inhibits certain forms of delayed cell
                 death, including neuronal death associated with
                 ischemia and excitotoxicity.",

                 granule neuron-Purkinje neuron (G-P) synapses and is a
                 candidate mechanism for the motor learning. Despite
                 extensive studies on its induction and expression
                 mechanisms, it has not been known how long the LTD
                 lasts. The LTD is accompanied by the decrease in the
                 postsynaptic responsiveness to glutamate, the
                 transmitter at G-P synapses. Therefore, during the LTD,
                 the amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) at G-P
                 synapses should decrease. We studied the depression of
                 mEPSC amplitudes (DME) as a possible contributing
                 factor for the LTD and found that the conditioning
                 treatment of cultured cerebellar neurons with 50 mM
                 K(+) and 100 microM glutamate, an analogous condition
                 used to induce the LTD, induced the long-lasting DME.
                 The mEPSC amplitudes recovered to the original level 48
                 hr after the 5 min conditioning treatment. Changing the
                 duration of the conditioning revealed that the DME
                 consisted of two distinct phases: the early phase
                 lasting for a few hours and the late phase for >1 d.
                 The latter was distinguished from the former by its
                 requirement of prolonged conditioning treatment and
                 syntheses of mRNA and protein for the induction. There
                 were critical periods for mRNA and protein syntheses.
                 The critical period for protein synthesis was much
                 longer than that for mRNA synthesis. These results
                 demonstrate that the DME lasts for 1-2 d and that it
                 consists of two phases, whose induction and maintenance

                 kinetics of Ca(2+) binding to calbindin-D(28K). The
                 experiments used saturated DM-nitrophen at a [Ca(2+)]
                 of 1.5 &mgr;M. Under these conditions, UV laser flashes
                 produced rapid steplike increases in [Ca(2+)] in the
                 absence of calbindin-D(28K), and in its presence the
                 decay of the flash-induced fluorescence was due solely
                 to the Ca(2+) buffering by the protein. We developed a
                 novel method for kinetic parameter derivation and used
                 the synthetic Ca(2+) buffer EGTA to confirm its
                 validity. We provide evidence that calbindin-D(28K)

                 interactions in living cells by fluorescence readouts,
                 we used a circularly permuted green fluorescent protein
                 (cpGFP), in which the amino and carboxyl portions had
                 been interchanged and reconnected by a short spacer
                 between the original termini. The cpGFP was fused to
                 calmodulin and its target peptide, M13. The chimeric
                 protein, which we have named pericam, was fluorescent
                 and its spectral properties changed reversibly with the
                 amount of Ca(2+), probably because of the interaction
                 between calmodulin and M13 leading to an alteration of
                 the environment surrounding the chromophore. Three
                 types of pericam were obtained by mutating several
                 amino acids adjacent to the chromophore. Of these,
                 flash-pericam became brighter with Ca(2+), whereas
                 inverse-pericam dimmed. On the other hand,
                 ratiometric-pericam had an excitation wavelength
                 changing in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. All of the
                 pericams expressed in HeLa cells were able to monitor
                 free Ca(2+) dynamics, such as Ca(2+) oscillations in
                 the cytosol and the nucleus. Ca(2+) imaging using
                 high-speed confocal line-scanning microscopy and a
                 flash-pericam allowed to detect the free propagation of
                 Ca(2+) ions across the nuclear envelope. Then, free
                 Ca(2+) concentrations in the nucleus and mitochondria
                 were simultaneously measured by using
                 ratiometric-pericams having appropriate localization
                 signals, revealing that extra-mitochondrial Ca(2+)
                 transients caused rapid changes in the concentration of
                 mitochondrial Ca(2+). Finally, a split-pericam was made
                 by deleting the linker in the flash-pericam. The
                 Ca(2+)-dependent interaction between calmodulin and M13
                 in HeLa cells was monitored by the association of the
                 two halves of GFP, neither of which was fluorescent by
                 itself.",

                 were evoked by backpropagating action potentials in
                 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices from the rat.
                 In the presence of the metabotropic glutamate receptor
                 (mGluR) agonists t-ACPD, DHPG, or CHPG, spikes caused
                 Ca(2+) waves that initiated in the proximal apical
                 dendrites and spread over this region and in the soma.
                 Consistent with previously described synaptic responses
                 (Nakamura et al., 1999a), pharmacological experiments
                 established that the waves were attributable to Ca(2+)
                 release from internal stores mediated by the
                 synergistic effect of receptor-mobilized inositol 1,4,
                 5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) and spike-evoked Ca(2+). The
                 amplitude of the changes reached several micromoles per
                 liter when detected with the low-affinity indicators
                 fura-6F, fura-2-FF, or furaptra. Repetitive brief spike
                 trains at 30-60 sec intervals generated increases of
                 constant amplitude. However, trains at intervals of
                 10-20 sec evoked smaller increases, suggesting that the
                 stores take 20-30 sec to refill. Release evoked by
                 mGluR agonists was blocked by MCPG, AIDA, 4-CPG, MPEP,
                 and LY367385, a profile consistent with the primacy of
                 group I receptors. At threshold agonist concentrations
                 the release was evoked only in the dendrites; threshold
                 antagonist concentrations were effective only in the
                 soma. Carbachol and 5-HT evoked release with the same
                 spatial distribution as t-ACPD, suggesting that the
                 distribution of neurotransmitter receptors was not
                 responsible for the restricted range of regenerative
                 release. Intracellular BAPTA and EGTA were
                 approximately equally effective in blocking release.
                 Extracellular Cd(2+) blocked release, but no single
                 selective Ca(2+) channel blocker prevented release.
                 These results suggest that IP(3) receptors are not
                 associated closely with specific Ca(2+) channels and
                 are not close to each other.",

                 [Ca2+]m was measured in a group (1 x 10[6] cells) of
                 MIN6 cells stably transfected with aequorin targeted at
                 the mitochondria. Exogenous ATP (0.25 mmol/l) produced
                 a single transient increase in [Ca2+]c whereas 22
                 mmol/l KCl produced a sustained plateau increase. ATP
                 and KCl evoked transient increases in [Ca2+]m but with

                 increase induced by ATP decreased more rapidly than

                 and [Ca2+]m signals in response to KCl and tolbutamide,
                 but not those to ATP. Peak levels of [Ca2+]m increase
                 (around 2 micromol/ l) exceeded those of [Ca2+]c
                 increase (around 500 nmol/l). A rise in glucose
                 concentration from 3 to 30 mmol/l induced oscillations
                 of [Ca2+]c that overlay the sustained increases in
                 [Ca2+]c in single cells. An oscillatory increase in
                 [Ca2+]m was similarly observed in response to glucose.
                 Addition of 10 mmol/l 2-ketoisocaproic acid at 20
                 mmol/l glucose further increased the plateau level of

                 signals is determined by the flux of calcium ions
                 across different biological membranes as well as by the
                 diffusional mobility of calcium and different calcium
                 buffers in the cell. To arrive at a quantitative
                 understanding of the determinants of these signals, one
                 needs to dissociate the flux contribution from the
                 redistribution and buffering of calcium. Since the
                 cytosol can be heterogeneous with respect to its
                 calcium buffering property, it is essential to assess
                 this property in a spatially resolved manner. In this
                 paper we report on two different methods to estimate
                 the cellular calcium binding of bovine adrenal
                 chromaffin cells. In the first method, we use
                 voltage-dependent calcium channels as a source to
                 generate calcium gradients in the cytosol. Using
                 imaging techniques, we monitor the dissipation of these
                 gradients to estimate local apparent calcium diffusion
                 coefficients and, from these, local calcium binding
                 ratios. This approach requires a very high
                 signal-to-noise ratio of the calcium measurement and
                 can be used when well-defined calcium gradients can be
                 generated throughout the cell. In the second method, we
                 overcome these problems by using calcium-loaded
                 DM-nitrophen as a light-dependent calcium source to
                 homogeneously and quantitatively release calcium in the
                 cytosol. By measuring [Ca2+] directly before and after
                 the photorelease process and knowing the total amount
                 of calcium being released photolytically, we get an
                 estimate of the fraction of calcium ions which does not
                 appear as free calcium and hence must be bound to
                 either the indicator dye or the endogenous calcium
                 buffer. This finally results in a two-dimensional map
                 of the distribution of the immobile endogenous calcium
                 buffer. We did not observe significant variations of
                 the cellular calcium binding at a spatial resolution of
                 approximately 2 &mgr;m. Furthermore, the calcium
                 binding is not reduced by increasing the resting [Ca2+]
                 to levels as high as 1.1 &mgr;M. This is indicative of
                 a low calcium affinity of the corresponding buffers and
                 is in agreement with a recent report on the affinity of
                 these buffers (Xu, T., M. Naraghi, H. Kang, and E.
                 Neher. 1997. Biophys. J. 73:532-545). In contrast to
                 the homogeneous distribution of the calcium buffers,
                 the apparant calcium diffusion coefficient did show
                 inhomogeneities, which can be attributed to restricted
                 diffusion at the nuclear envelope and to rim effects at
                 the cell membrane.",

                 function. Since there can be tight coupling between
                 inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca(2+) release
                 and elevation of mitochondrial calcium concentration,
                 we have investigated whether a similar relationship
                 exists between the release of Ca(2+) from the ryanodine
                 receptor and the elevation of mitochondrial Ca(2+).
                 Perfusion of permeabilized A10 cells with inositol 1,4,
                 5-trisphosphate resulted in a large transient elevation
                 of mitochondrial Ca(2+) to about 8 &mgr;m. The response
                 was inhibited by heparin but not ryanodine. Perfusion
                 of the cells with Ca(2+) buffers in excess of 1 &mgr;m
                 leads to large increases in mitochondrial Ca(2+) that
                 are much greater than the perfused Ca(2+). These
                 increases, which average around 10 &mgr;m, are enhanced
                 by caffeine and inhibited by ryanodine and depletion of
                 the intracellular stores with either orthovanadate or
                 thapsigargin. We conclude that Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)
                 release at the ryanodine receptor generates
                 microdomains of elevated Ca(2+) that are sensed by
                 adjacent mitochondria. In addition to
                 ryanodine-sensitive stores acting as a source of
                 Ca(2+), Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release is required to
                 generate efficient elevation of mitochondrial Ca(2+).",

                 regulate Ca(2+)-sensitive enzymes and gene
                 transcription, and generally the extent of agonist
                 activation of phospholipase C-linked G protein-coupled
                 receptors determines the type of Ca(2+) signal. We have
                 studied global Ca(2+) oscillations arising through
                 activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor
                 mGluR5a expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and
                 find that these oscillations are largely insensitive to
                 agonist concentration. Using an inducible receptor
                 expression system and a non-competitive antagonist, in
                 conjunction with the translocation of eGFP-PH(PLCdelta)
                 to monitor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3))
                 oscillations in single cells, we show that mGluR5a
                 density determines the frequency of these oscillations.
                 The predominant underlying mechanism resulted from a
                 negative feedback loop whereby protein kinase C (PKC)
                 inhibited InsP(3) generation. Down-regulation of PKC by
                 prolonged exposure to phorbol ester revealed a second
                 form of Ca(2+)(i) oscillation at low agonist
                 concentrations. These Ca(2+)(i) signals showed features
                 typical of classic repetitive Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)
                 release and were sensitive to agonist concentration.
                 Therefore, a single receptor can stimulate two types of
                 InsP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) signal dependent upon feedback
                 inhibition, producing two distinct means of controlling
                 the final pattern of Ca(2+)(i) release. Our results
                 have physiological implications for Ca(2+) signaling in
                 general and emphasize the importance of mGluR5 surface
                 expression for modulating synaptic plasticity.",

                 components provides a variety of possible spatial
                 structures: the regulatory machinery chooses the most
                 appropriate to express a given cellular function. Here
                 we study the extent and the characteristics of
                 self-organization using microtubules and molecular
                 motors as a model system. These components are known to
                 participate in the formation of many cellular
                 structures, such as the dynamic asters found in mitotic
                 and meiotic spindles. Purified motors and microtubules
                 have previously been observed to form asters in vitro.

                 the relative concentrations of the components, we
                 obtain a variety of self-organized structures. Further,
                 by studying this process in a constrained geometry of
                 micro-fabricated glass chambers, we demonstrate that

                 stores and the basolateral plasma membrane of gastric
                 parietal cells were studied using digital image
                 processing of fura-2 fluorescence. Cells were treated

                 Ca-adenosinetriphosphatase) or a combination of the
                 two. Ca-free solutions were used to selectively
                 investigate intracellular store release and plasma
                 membrane pump activity, whereas Ca-containing solutions
                 were used to investigate Ca influx and refilling of the
                 intracellular pool. In the resting cell depletion of
                 the intracellular pool in Ca-free solutions was 15-fold
                 faster than control in the presence of thapsigargin,
                 indicating the efficient (>90\%) recycling of leaked Ca
                 by the store Ca pump. Stimulation with carbachol
                 increased the rate of pool depletion by 70-fold, and
                 this Ca flux out of the internal store was ten times
                 larger than the flux across the plasma membrane. Thus
                 the internal store has ten times greater fluxes (both

                 resting and stimulated conditions. After carbachol
                 removal (i.e., reloading) the permeability of the
                 internal store decreases, whereas increased influx
                 across the plasma membrane persists until the store is
                 refilled. Cytoplasmic Ca does not increase during
                 refilling because the intracellular store pump operates
                 eightfold faster than the plasma membrane pump,

                 release from intracellular sequestering compartments
                 remains poorly understood. The rapid release of stored
                 Ca2+ requires large concentration gradients that had
                 been thought to result from low-affinity buffering of
                 Ca2+ by the polyanionic matrices within
                 Ca2+-sequestering organelles. However, our results here

                 inside the endoplasmic reticulum and in the mucin
                 granules remains at low levels (20-35 microM). But

                 undergoing large oscillations, leading to corresponding
                 oscillations of Ca2+ release to the cytosol. These
                 remarkable dynamics of luminal [Ca2+] result from a
                 fast and highly cooperative Ca2+/K+ ion-exchange
                 process rather than from Ca2+ transport into the lumen.
                 This common paradigm for Ca2+ storage and release,
                 found in two different Ca2+-sequestering organelles,
                 requires the functional interaction of three molecular
                 components: a polyanionic matrix that functions as a
                 Ca2+/K+ ion exchanger, and two Ca2+-sensitive channels,
                 one to import K+ into the Ca2+-sequestering
                 compartments, the other to release Ca2+ to the
                 cytosol.",

                 (delayed calcium deregulation, DCD) which precedes and

                 for the development and plasticity of the nervous
                 system. Repetitive correlated activation of pre- and
                 postsynaptic neurons can induce persistent enhancement
                 or decrement of synaptic efficacy, commonly referred to
                 as long-term potentiation or depression (LTP or LTD).
                 An important unresolved issue is whether and to what
                 extent LTP and LTD are restricted to the activated
                 synapses. Here we show that, in the CA1 region of the
                 hippocampus, reduction of postsynaptic calcium influx
                 by partial blockade of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)
                 receptors results in a conversion of LTP to LTD and a
                 loss of input specificity normally associated with LTP,
                 with LTD appearing at heterosynaptic inputs. The
                 induction of LTD at homo- and heterosynaptic sites
                 requires functional ryanodine receptors and inositol
                 triphosphate (InsP3) receptors, respectively.
                 Functional blockade or genetic deletion of type 1 InsP3
                 receptors led to a conversion of LTD to LTP and
                 elimination of heterosynaptic LTD, whereas blocking
                 ryanodine receptors eliminated only homosynaptic LTD.
                 Thus, postsynaptic Ca2+, deriving from Ca2+ influx and
                 differential release of Ca2+ from internal stores
                 through ryanodine and InsP3 receptors, regulates both
                 the polarity and input specificity of activity-induced

                 characteristic states: G1, when replication origins of

                 when they are in a post-replicative state (Nasmyth,
                 1995). Using straightforward biochemical kinetics, we
                 show that these two states can be created by
                 antagonistic interactions between cyclin-dependent
                 kinases (Cdk) and their foes: the cyclin-degradation
                 machinery (APC) and a stoichiometric inhibitor (CKI).
                 Irreversible transitions between these two
                 self-maintaining steady states drive progress through
                 the cell cycle: at Start a cell leaves the G1 state and
                 commences chromosome replication, and at Finish the
                 cell separates the products of replication to the
                 incipient daughter cells and re-enters G1. We propose
                 that a protein-phosphatase, by up-regulating the APC

                 altered membrane excitability during the inhibition of
                 mitochondrial metabolism in central mammalian neurons.
                 Perforated whole-cell patch clamp and fluorimetric
                 techniques were combined to examine changes in membrane
                 currents, intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and
                 mitochondrial potential (DeltaPsim) in neurons
                 dissociated from the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus of
                 young rats. 2. On application of the mitochondrial
                 inhibitor NaCN, or the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide
                 p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), the membrane
                 potential hyperpolarized and membrane conductance
                 increased. Under voltage clamp, an outward current was
                 seen. The reversal potential of the current at -83 mV
                 and its dependence on extracellular [K+] confirmed that
                 this was a K+ conductance. 3. Simultaneous recordings
                 of [Ca2+]i and current showed a striking correlation
                 between a rise in [Ca2+]i and the developed outward
                 current. Flash photolysis of the caged Ca2+ chelator,
                 diazo-2, reversed both the rise in [Ca2+]i and the
                 outward current. The current was reduced by 80 \% by
                 charybdotoxin, was attenuated by 10 mM TEA+ but was
                 unaffected by apamin or by the KATP channel blocker
                 tolbutamide (400 microM-1 mM). These data suggest
                 strongly that the current is carried by Ca2+-dependent
                 K+ channels. 4. Simultaneous recordings of membrane
                 current, DeltaPsim and [Ca2+]i revealed the sequence of
                 events in response to impaired mitochondrial function
                 (CN, FCCP or anoxia): DeltaPsim depolarized, followed
                 rapidly by an increase in [Ca2+]i followed in turn by
                 the outward current. [Ca2+]i and membrane current
                 recovered only after mitochondrial repolarization. 5.
                 The rise in [Ca2+]i appeared to result from an
                 increased Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+
                 channels. It was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and
                 was much reduced by methoxyverapamil (D600). The rate
                 of Mn2+ quench of fura-2 fluorescence was increased by
                 the inhibitors, and the inhibitors induced a small
                 inward current when K+ channels were blocked that
                 preceded the rise in [Ca2+]i. However, the increase in
                 [Ca2+]i showed no obvious dependence on membrane
                 potential in cells clamped at a range of holding
                 potentials from -90 to -45 mV. 6. Thus, removal of
                 oxygen, uncoupling mitochondrial oxidative
                 phosphorylation or inhibition of respiration, all lead
                 to mitochondrial depolarization, an increased Ca2+
                 influx through (voltage-gated) channels, even at
                 hyperpolarized membrane potentials, raising [Ca2+]i
                 which in turn drives an increased K+ conductance that
                 modulates membrane excitability.",

                 obtained from patients undergoing surgery for medically

                 and intact cells using the fluorescent probe,

                 {Delta}{Psi}m to be calculated with the Nernst

                 to fluorescence quenching and binding of dye to
                 mitochondrial membranes. We developed a new method to
                 determine the amplitude of flickers in terms of
                 millivolts of depolarization. TMRE fluorescence was
                 monitored using high-speed, high-sensitivity

                 fluorescence, indicating depolarizations and

                 depolarizations were reversible and did not result in
                 permanent depolarization of the mitochondria. The
                 magnitude of the flickers ranged from <10 mV to >100 mV
                 with a mean of 17.6 {+/-} 1.0 mV (n = 360) and a
                 distribution skewed to smaller values. Nearly all
                 mitochondria flickered, and they did so independently
                 of one another, indicating that mitochondria function

                 They are used to investigate the effects of acute and

                 of this neural network containing important cholinergic

                 by prior increase of [Ca2+]i, suggesting a cooperative
                 action of Ca2+ in InsP3 receptor activation.
                 InsP3-evoked flux and peak [Ca2+]i increased with InsP3
                 concentration up to 5-10 microM, with large variation
                 from cell to cell at each InsP3 concentration. The
                 duration of InsP3-evoked flux, measured as 10-90\%
                 risetime, showed a good reciprocal correlation with
                 d[Ca2+]i/dt and much less cell to cell variation than
                 the dependence of flux on InsP3 concentration,
                 suggesting that the rate of termination of the Ca2+
                 flux depends on the free Ca2+ flux itself. Comparing
                 this data between hepatocytes and Purkinje neurons
                 shows a similar reciprocal correlation for both, in
                 hepatocytes in the range of low Ca2+ flux, up to 50
                 microM. s-1 and in Purkinje neurons at high flux up to
                 1,400 microM. s-1. Experiments in which [Ca2+]i was
                 controlled at resting or elevated levels support a
                 mechanism in which InsP3-evoked Ca2+ flux is inhibited
                 by Ca2+ inactivation of closed receptor/channels due to
                 Ca2+ accumulation local to the release sites.
                 Hepatocytes have a much smaller, more prolonged
                 InsP3-evoked Ca2+ flux than Purkinje neurons. Evidence
                 suggests that these differences in kinetics can be
                 explained by the much lower InsP3 receptor density in
                 hepatocytes than Purkinje neurons, rather than
                 differences in receptor isoform, and, more generally,
                 that high InsP3 receptor density promotes fast rising,
                 rapidly inactivating InsP3-evoked [Ca2+]i transients.",

                 cells. Using evanescent wave microscopy we monitored
                 the behaviour of individual secretory vesicles at the
                 plasma membrane. Vesicles undergo sequential
                 transitions between several states of differing
                 fluorescence intensity and mobility. The transitions
                 are reversible, except for the fusion step, and even in
                 nonstimulated conditions the vesicles change states in
                 a dynamic equilibrium. Stimulation selectively speeds
                 up the three forward transitions leading towards
                 exocytosis. Vesicles lose mobility in all three
                 dimensions upon approach of the plasma membrane. Their
                 movement is directed and targeted to the docking fusion
                 sites. Sites of vesicle docking and exocytosis are
                 distributed non-uniformly over the studied footprint
                 region of the cell. While some areas are the sites of
                 repeated vesicle docking and fusion, others are
                 completely devoid of spots. Vesicular mobility at the
                 membrane is confined, as if the vesicle were imprisoned

                 Harris silicone substratum assay [Harris et al., 1980:
                 Science 208:177-179], but uses an improved
                 non-wrinkling film that deforms more predictably in
                 response to traction forces. The method also utilizes a
                 mathematical analysis of rubber deformation to produce
                 the final map of the distribution of tractions. The
                 resulting maps consistently showed that fish
                 keratocytes exert a steady-state pinching on the
                 substratum, perpendicular to the cell's direction of
                 locomotion. No significant rearward tractions were

                 with peeling of adhesions were found at the back of the

                 Huntington's disease, we prepared slice cultures of
                 striatal tissue from newborn rats. The striatal
                 cultures were grown for 12-39 days in the absence of
                 any other brain tissue. The presence of specific cell
                 markers was shown by immunocytochemistry,
                 histochemistry and in situ hybridization with
                 alkaline-phosphatase-labeled oligonucleotide probes. We
                 focused on (1) the medium-sized, aspiny interneurons,
                 which in vivo express the neuropeptides somatostatin
                 and neuropeptide Y and the nitric oxide synthesizing
                 enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
                 (NADPH)-diaphorase, and which are spared in
                 Huntington's disease and (2) the enkephalinergic,
                 medium-sized projection neurons, which are particularly
                 vulnerable in Huntington's disease. Similar basic
                 morphologies of the presumed interneurons and double
                 staining of NADPH-diaphorase positive and somatostatin
                 immunoreactive neurons suggest that the two
                 neuropeptides and NADPH-diaphorase are extensively
                 colocalized in the cultures, as in vivo. In the newborn
                 rats, included as controls, a patch-matrix distribution
                 of the NADPH-diaphorase staining is described for the
                 first time. In the striatal slices the distribution of
                 the NADPH-diaphorase staining stayed uneven after 3-5
                 weeks in culture, with areas almost devoid of staining
                 alternating with more heavily stained areas. This
                 pattern may represent an intermediate stage between the
                 patch-matrix distribution in the newborn and the
                 homogeneous staining in the adult rat striatum. From
                 quantitative estimates we found the same mutual rank
                 order of the numbers of neuropeptide Y- and
                 somatostatin-immunoreactive neurons and
                 NADPH-diaphorase positive neurons in vivo and in vitro.
                 Both in the slice cultures and in the brain, the number
                 of enkephalin mRNA-containing neurons significantly
                 exceeded that of neuropeptide Y- and somatostatin
                 mRNA-containing neurons. This implies that the mutual
                 distribution of presumed interneurons and projection
                 neurons was preserved in the slice cultures. Comparison
                 of cell numbers per unit volume showed that, in the
                 cultures, the number of presumed interneurons, with the
                 exception of NPY mRNA-containing neurons, significantly
                 exceeded that in vivo. In contrast, the enkephalin
                 mRNA-containing neurons, which in vivo are projection
                 neurons, were significantly fewer in the cultures. The
                 relative loss of projection neurons and preservation of
                 interneurons in single slice cultures of striatal
                 tissue apparently mimick some of the neurodegenerative
                 changes of Huntington's disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

  abstract =     "The ryanodine receptor (RR), an intracellular calcium
                 release channel, has been identified in the nervous
                 system but its contributions to neuronal function are
                 unknown. We have utilized immunohistochemical
                 techniques to establish the distribution of RRs in the
                 central nervous system (CNS) of the chick as a step
                 toward elucidating the function of RRs in this system.
                 RR immunoreactivity is observed throughout the brain,
                 most prominently in large neurons. The strongest
                 immunoreactivity is found in cerebellar Purkinje
                 neurons, but nuclei in the motor, visual and vestibular
                 systems are also intensely labeled, and immunoreactive
                 neurons are observed the olfactory bulb and the
                 hippocampus. In these neurons, labeling is prominent in
                 cell bodies, dendrites and axons, but is not observed
                 in the dendritic spines or in plasma membranes. The
                 neuronal RRs bind [3H]ryanodine with high affinity and
                 this activity is regulated by calcium, caffeine,
                 MgCl2/ATP and ionic strength. Multiple forms of the RRs
                 are found in the chicken CNS. Immunoprecipitation and
                 localization studies using RR isoform specific
                 monoclonal antibodies reveal major differences in their
                 distribution. The predominant species in the cerebellum
                 is similar to the skeletal muscle isoform while there
                 is a lower level of expression of either the cardiac or
                 beta skeletal isoforms. In the remainder of the brain,
                 the predominant isoform is similar to the cardiac or
                 beta skeletal muscle isoforms. The broad distribution
                 of RRs in the CNS suggests that calcium release events
                 mediated by these proteins may have a functional role
                 in a diverse array of neurons. Moreover within the
                 populations of neurons expressing RR's, the presence of
                 specific RR isoforms may correlate with specialization
                 in the calcium release events mediated by these
                 proteins.",

                 antibodies in the developing chicken brain, from E18
                 through adulthood, using light and electron microscopic
                 immunocytochemistry. Monoclonal antibody 110F is
                 specific for the alpha-skeletal muscle form of RyR,
                 while monoclonal antibody 110E recognizes both the
                 beta-skeletal muscle and cardiac isoforms, but does not
                 distinguish between the two. Significant differences in
                 the distribution of the alpha- and beta/cardiac forms
                 were observed. Labeling for the alpha-form was
                 restricted to cerebellar Purkinje neurons while the
                 beta/cardiac form was observed in neurons throughout
                 the brain. A major finding was the presence of labeling
                 for the beta/cardiac in presynaptic terminals of the
                 parallel fibers in the molecular layer and the mossy
                 fiber terminals in the granular layer glomeruli in late
                 development and during adulthood. Labeling for the
                 beta/cardiac, but not the alpha-form, underwent a major
                 redistribution in the cerebellum during the course of
                 development. At 1 day of age, beta/cardiac labeling was
                 present mainly in Purkinje neurons. From 1 day to 4
                 weeks, immunolabeling for the beta/cardiac form
                 gradually disappeared from Purkinje neurons, but
                 increased in granule cells. Within the molecular layer,
                 the labeling pattern changed from being primarily
                 within Purkinje dendrites to a more diffuse pattern.
                 Electron microscopic examination of the cerebellar
                 molecular layer of 2-week-old chicks revealed that
                 beta/cardiac-labeling was mainly present in the axons
                 and presynaptic processes of the parallel fibers. No
                 developmental changes were observed in other brain
                 regions. This study represents the first demonstration
                 of ryanodine receptor immunoreactivity in presynaptic
                 boutons and suggests that the ryanodine receptor may
                 modulate neurotransmitter release through local
                 regulation of intracellular calcium in the parallel
                 fiber synapse.",

                 of endocytic organelles in live cells. In this report,
                 we demonstrate that the ratiometric fluorescent pH
                 indicator 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (HPTS)
                 is the most advantageous available probe for such pH
                 measurements. To measure intraorganelle pH, cells were
                 labeled by endocytic uptake of HPTS, the ratio of
                 fluorescence emission intensities at excitation
                 wavelengths of 450 nm and 405 nm (F450/405) was
                 calculated for each organelle, and ratios were
                 converted to pH values by using standard curves for
                 F450/405 vs. pH. Proper calibration is critical for
                 accurate measurement of pH values: standard curves
                 generated in vitro yielded artifactually low organelle
                 pH values. Calibration was unaffected by the use of
                 culture medium buffered with various buffers or
                 different cell types. By using this technique, we show
                 that both acidic and neutral endocytically derived
                 organelles exist in the axons of sympathetic neurons in
                 different steady-state proportions than in the cell
                 body. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these axonal
                 organelles have a bimodal pH distribution, indicating a
                 rapid acidification step in their maturation that
                 reduces the average pH of a fraction of the organelles
                 by 2 pH units while leaving few organelles of
                 intermediate pH at steady state. Finally, we
                 demonstrate a spatial gradient or organelle pH along
                 axons, with the relative frequency of acidic organelles
                 increasing with proximity to the cell body.",

                 insights in living cells is impeded by the membrane
                 impermeability of these anionic lipids. We describe a
                 carrier system for intracellular delivery of
                 phosphoinositide polyphosphates (PIP(n)s) and
                 fluorescently labeled PIP(n)s into living cells, such
                 that intracellular localization can be directly
                 observed. Preincubation of PIP(n)s or inositol
                 phosphates with carrier polyamines produced complexes
                 that entered mammalian, plant, yeast, bacterial, and
                 protozoal cells in seconds to minutes via a
                 nonendocytic mechanism. Time-dependent transit of both
                 PIP(n)s and the carrier to specific cytosolic and
                 nuclear compartments was readily visualized by
                 fluorescence microscopy. Platelet-derived growth factor
                 treatment of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts containing
                 carrier-delivered phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate

                 resulted in the redistribution of the fluorescent
                 signal, suggesting that fluorescent PtdIns(4,5)P(2) was
                 a substrate for phospholipase C. We also observed a

                 and PtdIns(4,5)P(2) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate

                 receptor (RyR/IP3R)-mediated cytosolic Ca2+ signals
                 propagate to the mitochondria, initiating chains of
                 events vital in the regulation of different cellular
                 functions. However, the fraction of released Ca2+
                 utilized by the mitochondria during these processes has
                 not been quantified. To measure the amount of Ca2+
                 taken up by the mitochondria, we used a novel approach
                 that involves simultaneous fluorescence imaging of
                 mitochondrial and cytosolic [Ca2+] in permeabilized
                 H9c2 myotubes and RBL-2H3 mast cells. Communication
                 between sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) and
                 mitochondria is maintained in these permeabilized
                 cells, as evidenced by the large RyR/IP3R-driven
                 mitochondrial matrix [Ca2+] and NAD(P)H signals and
                 also by preservation of the morphology of the
                 SR/ER-mitochondrial junctions. Ca2+ was released from
                 the SR/ER by addition of saturating caffeine or IP3 and
                 subsequently thapsigargin (Tg), an inhibitor of SR/ER
                 Ca2+ pumps. The amount of Ca2+ transmitted to the
                 mitochondria was determined by measuring increases of
                 global [Ca2+] in the incubation medium (cytosolic
                 [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c)). Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was
                 calculated from the difference between [Ca2+]c
                 responses recorded in the absence and presence of
                 uncoupler or from [Ca2+]c elevations evoked by
                 uncoupler or ionophore applied after complete Ca2+
                 mobilization from the SR/ER. [Ca2+]c increases were
                 calibrated by adding Ca2+ pulses to the permeabilized
                 cells. In H9c2 cells, caffeine induced partial
                 mobilization of SR Ca2+ and mitochondria accumulated
                 26\% of the released Ca2+. Sequential application of
                 caffeine and Tg elicited complete discharge of SR Ca2+
                 without further increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.
                 In RBL-2H3 mast cells, IP3 by itself elicited complete
                 discharge of the ER Ca2+ store and the increase of the
                 ionophore-releasable mitochondrial Ca2+ content reached
                 50\% of the Ca2+ amount mobilized by IP3 + Tg. Thus,
                 RyR/IP3R direct a substantial fraction of released Ca2+

                 inherited defect in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
                 exhibit a decreased ability to sequester cytosolic Ca2+

                 concentration ([Ca2+]c) to comparable levels in control
                 and PDH-deficient fibroblasts. In normal fibroblasts
                 transfected with plasmid DNA encoding

                 increase in Ca2(+)-dependent aequorin luminescence
                 corresponding to an increase in the mitochondrial Ca2+
                 concentration ([Ca2+]mt) of 2.0 +/- 0.2 microM. The
                 mitochondrial uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide

                 for the involvement of gap junctions in the propagation
                 of intercellular Ca(2+) waves. Gap junction-deficient
                 HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for
                 green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the
                 cytoplasmic carboxyl termini of connexin 43 (Cx43), 32
                 (Cx32), or 26 (Cx26). The subsequently expressed
                 GFP-labeled gap junctions rendered the cells dye- and
                 electrically coupled and were detected at the plasma
                 membranes at points of contact between adjacent cells.
                 To correlate the distribution of gap junctions with the
                 changes in [Ca(2+)](i) associated with Ca(2+) waves and
                 the distribution of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),

                 (fluo-3 and fura-2) and ER membrane (ER-Tracker) dyes.
                 Digital high-speed microscopy was used to collect a
                 series of image slices from which the three-dimensional
                 distribution of the gap junctions and ER were
                 reconstructed. Subsequently, intercellular Ca(2+) waves
                 were induced in these cells by mechanical stimulation
                 with or without extracellular apyrase, an ATP-degrading
                 enzyme. In untransfected HeLa cells and in the absence
                 of apyrase, cell-to-cell propagating [Ca(2+)](i)
                 changes were characterized by initiating Ca(2+) puffs
                 associated with the perinuclear ER. By contrast, in
                 Cx-GFP-transfected cells and in the presence of
                 apyrase, [Ca(2+)](i) changes were propagated without
                 initiating perinuclear Ca(2+) puffs and were
                 communicated between cells at the sites of the Cx-GFP
                 gap junctions. The efficiency of Cx expression
                 determined the extent of Ca(2+) wave propagation. These

  abstract =     "The mechanism by which growing neurites sense and
                 respond to small applied electrical fields is not
                 known, but there is some evidence that the entry of
                 Ca(2+) from the external medium, with the subsequent
                 formation of intracellular Ca(2+) gradients, is
                 important in this process. We have employed two
                 approaches to test this idea. Xenopus spinal neurites
                 were exposed to electrical fields in a culture medium
                 in which Ca(2+) was chelated to very low levels
                 compared to the normal extracellular concentration of 2
                 mM. In other experiments, loading the neurites with the
                 calcium buffer, 1,
                 2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid
                 (BAPTA), disrupted the putative internal Ca(2+)
                 gradients, and the effects on the electrical response
                 were determined. Fields of 100 mV/mm were applied for
                 12 h, and no difference was detected in the cathodal
                 turning response between the treated neurites and the
                 untreated controls. Using the Differential Growth Index
                 (DGI), an asymmetry index, to quantitate the turning
                 response, we recorded DGIs of -0.64, -0.65, and -0.62
                 for control cells, cells in Ca(2+)-free medium, and
                 cells preloaded with BAPTA, respectively. Furthermore,
                 we detected an increase in neurite length for those
                 neurons cultured in Ca(2+)-free medium; they were
                 1.5-1.7 times as long as neurites from neurons cultured
                 in normal Ca(2+) medium. Likewise, we found that
                 BAPTA-loaded neurites were longer than control
                 neurites. Our data indicate that neuronal
                 galvanotropism is independent of the entry of external
                 Ca(2+) or of internal Ca(2+) gradients. Both
                 cell-permeant agonistic and antagonistic analogs of
                 cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) increased
                 the response to applied electrical fields.",

  abstract =     "Cell migration is a complex process that can be
                 considered as a repeated cycle of lamellipod extension
                 and attachment, cytoskeletal contraction, and tail
                 detachment, While lamellipodial and cytoskeletal
                 phenomena are currently the focus of considerable
                 research on cell migration, under many conditions
                 locomotion appears to be rate-limited by events at the
                 cell rear, especially release of cell/substratum
                 adhesions, To study the mechanism of tail detachment,
                 we have developed a novel experimental system that
                 permits observation of integrin dynamics on the ventral
                 surface of migrating fibroblasts. Photoactivatable
                 caged fluorescein is to a non-adhesion-perturbing
                 anti-avian-beta 1 subunit antibody, which labels
                 integrins on chicken fibroblasts migrating on a
                 laminin-coated glass coverslip, Ultraviolet light is
                 focused through a pinhole to photoactivate the caged
                 fluorophore in a 10-mu m-diameter spot at the rear of a
                 polarized cell, The fate of integrins initially present
                 in this spot is monitored using a cooled CCD camera to
                 follow the movement of fluorescent intensity as a
                 function of time over a 2 to 3 hour period. We find
                 that a substantial fraction of the integrins is left
                 behind on the substratum as the cell detaches and
                 locomotes, while another fraction collects into
                 vesicles which are transported along the cell body as
                 the cell migrates, As aggregates rip from the cell
                 membrane, the integrin-cytoskeletal bonds are
                 preferentially fractured resulting in 81+/-15\% of the
                 integrin remaining attached to the substratum, We
                 additionally find that adhesions sometimes disperse
                 into integrins which can form new adhesions at other
                 locations in the cell, Adhesions along the cell edge
                 can release from the substrate and translocate with the
                 cell, They either disperse in the cell membrane, rip
                 from the cell membrane and remain attached to the
                 substratum, or form a new aggregate, These observations
                 indicate that the behavior of integrins at the cell
                 rear is much more dynamic than previously appreciated,
                 suggesting that an important locus for regulation of
                 motility may reside in this region. [References: 39]",

                 with easy solution access to both sides were obtained
                 by painting a phospholipid:decane mixture across a
                 cylindrical pore etched into a 200-&mgr;m thick silicon
                 wafer. Silanization of the SiO(2) layer produced a
                 hydrophobic surface that promoted the adhesion of the
                 lipid mixture. Standard lithographic techniques and
                 anisotropic deep-reactive ion etching were used to
                 create pores with diameters from 50 to 200 ˆmgr;m. The
                 cylindrical structure of the pore in the partition and

                 to mechanical work. Because this coupling process is
                 believed to involve Ca2+, the roles of mitochondrial
                 Ca2+ in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation was
                 studied in isolated rat heart mitochondria. The
                 electrical component of the mitochondrial membrane
                 potential (delta psi) and the redox state of the
                 pyridine nucleotides were determined during the
                 oxidation of various substrates under different
                 metabolic states. In the absence of added adenine
                 nucleotides, the NADP+ redox couple was almost
                 completely reduced, regardless of the specific
                 substrate and the presence of Ca2+, whereas NAD+ couple
                 redox state was highly dependent on the substrate type
                 and the presence of Ca2+. Titration of respiration with
                 ADP, in the presence of excesshexokinase and glucose,
                 showed that both respiration and NAD(P)+reduction were
                 very sensitive to ADP. The maximal enzyme reaction rate
                 of ADP-stimulated respiration Michaelis constants (Km)
                 for ADP were dependent on the particular substrate
                 employed. delta psi was much less sensitive to ADP.
                 With either alpha-ketoglutarate or glutamate as
                 substrate, Ca2+ significantly increased reduction of
                 NAD(P)+.Ca2+ did not influence NAD(P)+ reduction with
                 either acetylcarnitine or pyruvate as substrate. In the
                 presence of ADP, delta psi was increased by Ca2+ at all
                 metabolic states with glutamate plus malate, 0.5 mM
                 alpha-ketoglutarate plus malate, or pyruvate plus
                 malate as substrates. The data presented support the
                 hypothesis that cardiac respiration is controlled by
                 the availability of both Ca2+ and ADP to mitochondria.
                 The data indicate that an increase in substrate supply
                 to mitochondria can increase mitochondrial respiration
                 at given level of ADP. This effect can be produced by
                 Ca2+ with substrates such as glutamate, which utilize
                 alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity for
                 oxidation. Increases in respiration by Ca2+ may
                 mitigate an increase in ADP during periods of increased
                 cardiac work.",

                 of separate subunits by monitoring movements of Ca(2+)
                 and small fluorescent probes in the ER lumen of
                 pancreatic acinar cells, using confocal microscopy,
                 local bleaching and uncaging. We observed rapid
                 movements and equilibration of Ca(2+) and the probes.
                 The bulk of the ER at the base was not connected to the
                 granules in the apical part, but diffusion into small
                 apical ER extensions occurred. The connectivity of the
                 ER Ca(2+) store was robust, since even supramaximal
                 acetylcholine (ACh) stimulation for 30 min did not
                 result in functional fragmentation. ACh could elicit a
                 uniform decrease in the ER Ca(2+) concentration
                 throughout the cell, but repetitive cytosolic Ca(2+)
                 spikes, induced by a low ACh concentration, hardly
                 reduced the ER Ca(2+) level. We conclude that the ER is
                 a functionally continuous unit, which enables efficient
                 Ca(2+) liberation. Ca(2+) released from the apical ER
                 terminals is quickly replenished from the bulk of the

                 receptors were characterized by using a scintillation
                 proximity assay. In the absence of Ca2+, 125I-labeled
                 calmodulin reversibly bound to multiple sites on InsP3
                 receptors and Ca2+ increased the binding by 190\% +/-
                 10\%; the half-maximal effect occurred when the Ca2+
                 concentration was 184 +/- 14 nM. In the absence of
                 Ca2+, calmodulin caused a reversible,
                 concentration-dependent (IC50 = 3.1 +/-0.2 microM)
                 inhibition of [3H]InsP3 binding by decreasing the
                 affinity of the receptor for InsP3. This effect was
                 similar at all Ca2+ concentrations, indicating that the

                 has similar affinities for calmodulin and
                 Ca2+-calmodulin. Calmodulin (10 microM) inhibited the
                 Ca2+ release from cerebellar microsomes evoked by
                 submaximal, but not by maximal, concentrations of

                 concentrations of calmodulin within cerebellar Purkinje
                 cells may account for their relative insensitivity to
                 InsP3 and limit spontaneous activation of InsP3
                 receptors in the dendritic spines. Inhibition of InsP3
                 receptors by calmodulin at all cytosolic Ca2+
                 concentrations, together with the known redistribution
                 of neuronal calmodulin evoked by protein kinases and
                 Ca2+, suggests that calmodulin may also allow both
                 feedback control of InsP3 receptors and integration of
                 inputs from other signaling pathways.",

                 (ER) Ca2+ stores and plasma membrane (PM)
                 store-operated Ca2+ entry channels was probed through a
                 novel combination of cytoskeletal modifications.
                 Whereas coupling was unaffected by disassembly of the
                 actin cytoskeleton, in situ redistribution of F-actin
                 into a tight cortical layer subjacent to the PM
                 displaced cortical ER and prevented coupling between ER
                 and PM Ca2+ entry channels, while not affecting
                 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated store release.
                 Importantly, disassembly of the induced cortical actin
                 layer allowed ER to regain access to the PM and
                 reestablish coupling of Ca2+ entry channels to Ca2+
                 store depletion. Coupling is concluded to be mediated
                 by a physical secretion-like mechanism involving close
                 but reversible interactions between the ER and the
                 PM.",

                 the subsequent rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration
                 ([Ca2+]i) have been implicated in cytotoxic processes
                 that lead to irreversible neuronal injury. While many
                 studies have focused on cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis,
                 much less is known about Ca2+ fluxes in subcellular
                 organelles, such as mitochondria. The mitochondria play
                 an important role in Ca2+ homeostasis by sequestering
                 cytosolic Ca2+ loads. However, mitochondrial Ca2+
                 overload can impair ATP synthesis, induce free radical
                 formation, and lead to lipid peroxidation. Thus, it is
                 also important to understand the mitochondrial Ca2+
                 fluxes induced by NMDA. In this study, changes in
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]m) in cultured
                 striatal neurons were monitored with a Ca(2+)-binding
                 fluorescent probe, rhod-2, and laser scanning confocal
                 microscopy. The rhod-2 fluorescence signal was highly
                 localized in mitochondrial areas of confocal images. A
                 rapid increase of [Ca2+]m was observed when neurons
                 were treated with 100 microM NMDA. The increased
                 [Ca2+]m induced by NMDA could not be observed in the
                 presence of ruthenium red, an inhibitor of the
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, or CCCP, a protonophore
                 that breaks down the mitochondrial membrane potential
                 necessary for Ca2+ uptake. The magnitude and
                 reversibility of changes in [Ca2+]m induced by NMDA
                 were variable. In neurons receiving multiple pulses of
                 NMDA, [Ca2+]m did not return to baseline. The elevated
                 [Ca2+]m may persist indefinitely and may rise further
                 after successive NMDA exposures. These data demonstrate
                 that Ca2+ accumulates in mitochondria in response to
                 NMDA receptor activation. This Ca2+ accumulation may
                 play a role in the excitotoxic mitochondrial
                 dysfunction induced by NMDA.",

                 procedure by which the cytosolic calcein signal was
                 quenched by Co2+. In hepatocytes and MH1C1 cells
                 coloaded with Co2+ and calcein AM, treatment with MTP
                 inducers caused a rapid, though limited, decrease in
                 mitochondrial calcein fluorescence, which was
                 significantly reduced by CsA. We also observed a
                 constant and spontaneous decrease in mitochondrial
                 calcein fluorescence, which was completely prevented by
                 CsA. Thus MTP likely fluctuates rapidly between open
                 and closed states in intact cells.",

  abstract =     "We have investigated control mechanisms involved in
                 the propagation of agonist-induced Ca2+ waves in
                 isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells. Using a
                 confocal laser-scanning microscope, we were able to
                 show that maximal stimulation of cells with
                 acetylcholine (ACh, 500 nM) or bombesin (1 nM) caused
                 an initial Ca2+ release of comparable amounts with both
                 agonists at the luminal cell pole. Subsequent Ca2+
                 spreading to the basolateral membrane was faster with
                 ACh (17.3 +/-5.4 microns/s) than with bombesin (8.0 +/-
                 2.2 microns/s). The speed of bombesin-induced Ca2+
                 waves could be increased up to the speed of ACh-induced
                 Ca2+ waves by inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC).
                 Activation of PKC significantly decreased the speed of
                 ACh-induced Ca2+ waves but had only little effect on
                 bombesin-evoked Ca2+ waves. Within 3 s after
                 stimulation, production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
                 [Ins(1,4,5)P3] was higher in the presence of ACh
                 compared with bombesin, whereas bombesin induced higher
                 levels of diacylglycerol (DAG) than ACh. These data
                 suggest that the slower propagation speed of
                 bombesin-induced Ca2+ waves is due to higher activation
                 of PKC in the presence of bombesin compared with ACh.
                 The higher increase in bombesin-compared with
                 ACh-induced DAG production is probably due to
                 activation of phospholipase D (PLD). Inhibition of the
                 PLD-dependent DAG production by preincubation with
                 0.3\% butanol led to an acceleration of the
                 bombesin-induced Ca2+ wave. In further experiments, we
                 could show that ruthenium red (100 microM), an
                 inhibitor of Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release in skeletal
                 muscle, also decreased the speed of ACh-induced Ca2+
                 waves. The effect of ruthenium red was not additive to
                 the effect of PKC activation. From the data, we
                 conclude that, following Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+
                 release in the luminal cell pole, secondary Ca2+
                 release from stores, which are located in series
                 between the luminal and the basal plasma membrane,
                 modifies Ca2+ spreading toward the basolateral cell
                 side by Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. Activation of PKC
                 leads to a reduction in Ca2+ release from these stores
                 and therefore could explain the slower propagation of
                 Ca2+ waves in the presence of bombesin compared with
                 ACh.",

                 for multiphoton excited three-dimensional free-form
                 fabrication with proteins. These reagents were
                 developed with the goal of cross-linking Type 1
                 collagen. This cross-linking process produces
                 structures on the micron and submicron size scales. A
                 rose bengal diisopropyl amine derivative combines the
                 classic photoactivator and co-initiator system into one
                 molecule, reducing the reaction kinetics and increasing
                 cross-linking efficiency. This derivative was
                 successful at producing stable structures from
                 collagen, whereas rose bengal alone was not effective.
                 A benzophenone dimer connected by a flexible diamine
                 tether was also synthesized. This activator has two
                 photochemically reactive groups and is highly efficient
                 in cross-linking bovine serum albumin and Type 1
                 collagen to form stable, robust structures. This
                 approach is more flexible in terms of cross-linking a
                 variety of proteins than by traditional benzophenone
                 photochemistry. The photophysical properties vary
                 greatly from that of benzophenone, with the appearance
                 of a new, lower energy absorption band (lambda max
                 approximately 370 nm in water) and broad, visible
                 emission band (approximately 500 nm maximum). This
                 absorption band is highly solvatochromic, suggesting it
                 arises, at least in part, from a charge transfer
                 interaction. Collagens are typically difficult to
                 cross-link photochemically, and the results here
                 suggest that these two new activators will be suitable
                 for cross-linking other forms of collagen and
                 additional proteins for biomedical applications such as
                 the de novo assembly of biomimetic tissue scaffolds.",

                 net mitochondrial Ca uptake during stimulus-evoked
                 [Ca(2+)](i) elevations are not well understood. Here,
                 we report direct measurements of depolarization-induced
                 changes in intramitochondrial total Ca concentration
                 ([Ca](mito)) obtained by x-ray microanalysis of rapidly
                 frozen neurons from frog sympathetic ganglia.
                 Unstimulated control cells exhibited undetectably low
                 [Ca](mito), but high K(+) depolarization (50 mM, 45
                 sec), which elevates [Ca(2+)](i) to approximately 600
                 nM, increased [Ca](mito) to 13.0 +/- 1.5 mmol/kg dry
                 weight; this increase was abolished by carbonyl cyanide
                 p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP). The
                 elevation of [Ca](mito) was a function of both
                 depolarization strength and duration. After
                 repolarization, [Ca](mito) recovered to prestimulation
                 levels with a time course that paralleled the decline
                 in [Ca(2+)](i). Depolarization-induced increases in
                 [Ca](mito) were spatially heterogeneous. At the level
                 of single mitochondria, [Ca](mito) elevations depended
                 on proximity to the plasma membrane, consistent with
                 predictions of a diffusion model that considers radial
                 [Ca(2+)](i) gradients that exist early during
                 depolarization. Within individual mitochondria, Ca was

                 investigated on planar bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs),
                 containing myristic, stearic, or linoleic long-chain
                 fatty acids (FA). In response to a transbilayer pH
                 gradient, a difference in the surface charges between
                 inner and outer leaflets appeared. Because the BLM was
                 formed from FA and neutral lipid, a surface potential
                 difference was originated solely by a concentration
                 difference of the initially equally distributed ionized
                 FA. As revealed by zeta-potential measurements, the
                 corresponding surface potential difference DeltaPhi(s)
                 was at least twice the value expected from a titration
                 of the FA alone. The additional surface charge was
                 attributed to FA flip-flop induced by the transbilayer
                 pH gradient. DeltaPhi(s) was derived from capacitive
                 current measurements carried out with a direct current
                 (dc) bias and was corrected for changes of membrane
                 dipole potential Phi(d). Dual-wavelength ratiometric
                 fluorescence measurements have shown that Phi(d) values
                 of the pure DPhPC bilayers and BLMs containing 40 mol
                 \% FA differ by less than 6\%. It is concluded that
                 fast FA flip-flop is not restricted to membranes with
                 high curvature. The role of pH gradient as an effective
                 driving force for the regulation of FA uptake is
                 discussed.",

                 units are the building blocks. This study presents a
                 new, nonlinear, two-region, axially distributed, single
                 capillary, BTEX model. A facilitated transporter model
                 is used to describe mass transfer between plasma and
                 intracellular spaces. To provide fast and accurate
                 solutions, numerical techniques suited to nonlinear
                 convection-dominated problems are implemented. These
                 techniques are the random choice method, an explicit
                 Euler-Lagrange scheme, and the MacCormack method with
                 and without flux correction. The accuracy of the
                 numerical techniques is demonstrated, and their

                 numerical methods stable without degrading their
                 efficiency. Numerical solutions are also used to

                 decades, the physiological significance of this

                 release from intracellular stores, trigger or modulate
                 many fundamental neuronal processes, including

                 the intracellular compartments involved in Ca2+
                 clearance, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has received
                 the most attention because it expresses Ca2+ pumps and
                 Ca2+ channels, thus endowing it with the potential to
                 act as both an intracellular calcium sink and store. We
                 review here our ongoing work on the role of calcium
                 sequestration into, and release from, ER cisterns and
                 the role that this plays in the generation and

                 later neuronal differentiation stages (3-4 DIV), are
                 also functionally expressed in the axons of immature
                 neurons. At this developmental stage preceding
                 synaptogenesis, N-type (but not L-type) channels are
                 involved in controlling synaptic vesicle recycling. It
                 is only at later developmental stages (10-12 DIV), when
                 the neurons have established a clear axodendritic
                 polarity and form synaptic contacts, that N-type
                 channels are progressively excluded from the axon.
                 Electrophysiological recordings of single neurons
                 growing in microislands revealed that synaptic
                 maturation coincides with a progressive increase in
                 N-type channels in the somatodendritic region and a
                 progressive decrease in the N-type channels supporting
                 glutamate release from the presynaptic terminal. These
                 results indicate that L-type and N-type calcium
                 channels undergo dynamic, developmentally regulated
                 rearrangements in regional distribution and function
                 and also suggest that different mechanisms may be
                 involved in the sorting and/or stabilization of these
                 two types of channels in different plasma membrane
                 domains during neuronal differentiation. Copyright 2000

                 visual scene invariably involve the interactions among
                 neurons throughout all of visual cortex. One hypothesis
                 is that the timing of neuronal activity, as well as the
                 amplitude of activity, provides a means to encode
                 features of objects. The experimental data from studies
                 on cat [Gray, C. M., Konig, P., Engel, A. K. \& Singer,
                 W. (1989) Nature (London) 338, 334-337] support a view
                 in which only synchronous (no phase lags) activity
                 carries information about the visual scene. In
                 contrast, theoretical studies suggest, on the one hand,
                 the utility of multiple phases within a population of
                 neurons as a means to encode independent visual
                 features and, on the other hand, the likely existence
                 of timing differences solely on the basis of network
                 dynamics. Here we use widefield imaging in conjunction
                 with voltage-sensitive dyes to record electrical
                 activity from the virtually intact, unanesthetized
                 turtle brain. Our data consist of single-trial
                 measurements. We analyze our data in the frequency
                 domain to isolate coherent events that lie in different
                 frequency bands. Low frequency oscillations (<5 Hz) are
                 seen in both ongoing activity and activity induced by
                 visual stimuli. These oscillations propagate parallel
                 to the afferent input. Higher frequency activity, with
                 spectral peaks near 10 and 20 Hz, is seen solely in
                 response to stimulation. This activity consists of
                 plane waves and spiral-like waves, as well as more
                 complex patterns. The plane waves have an average phase
                 gradient of approximately pi/2 radians/mm and propagate
                 orthogonally to the low frequency waves. Our results
                 show that large-scale differences in neuronal timing
                 are present and persistent during visual processing.",

                 erential-Interference-Contrast (DIC) microscopy is
                 essential for quantitative interpretation of DIC images
                 which provide information related to the gradient of a
                 specimen's optical-path-length (OPL) distribution along
                 the shear direction of the microscope. The work
                 presented in this dissertation pro- vides: 1, imaging
                 models for DIC microscopy that are essential for phase
                 estimation; and 2, a phase-estimation method which
                 permits the calculation of a specimen's phase function
                 or OPL distribution from DIC images. Two- and
                 three-dimensional imaging models for DIC imaging were
                 derived and tested using phantom specimens viewed with
                 several conventional DIC microscopes. Measured DIC
                 images were compared to model predictions which were
                 generated using theoretical PSFs, computer-generated
                 phantoms, and estimated imaging parameters such as bias
                 and shear. Results show anumber of similarities between
                 the point-aperture model and data suggesting that, for
                 many applications, this model may be adequate for phase
                 estimation. Further evaluation of the general model is
                 needed. A phase- estimation method was developed based
                 on our model and a new idea called rotational
                 diversity, which incorporates multiple DIC images
                 acquired at di erent specimen rotations. The method
                 uses the conjugate-gradient optimization approach to
                 estimate a specimen's phase function from multiple DIC
                 images by minimizing either the least squares or the
                 I-divergence discrepancy measure. Results obtained from
                 testing our method with both simulations and measured
                 DIC images demonstrate that: 1, a signi cant
                 improvement in the quanti cation and the resolution of
                 an estimated phase image is achieved when two DIC
                 images are used compared to the phase estimated from a
                 single DIC image; and 2, in some cases, using more than
                 two DIC images at distinct rotation angles improves the
                 estimated phase. The latter was shown with results
                 obtained from simulations in which deviations from
                 ideal conditions were modeled. Encouraging results were
                 also obtained from applica- tion of the method to DIC
                 images of bovine spermatozoa: the OPL summed over a
                 cell in an image estimated from two or more
                 rotationally-diverse DIC was found to be much more
                 reliable (with variability up to 1.3\%) than that
                 computed from single DIC images (which varies up to
                 20\%).",

                 endoplasmic reticulum participates in and is influenced
                 by signal transduction pathways. The endoplasmic
                 reticulum provides a Ca2+ store that can be mobilized
                 either by calcium-induced calcium release or by the
                 diffusible messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.
                 Depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores provides
                 a signal that activates surface membrane Ca2+ channels,
                 a process known as capacitative calcium entry.
                 Depletion of endoplasmic reticulum stores can also
                 signal long-term cellular responses such as gene
                 expression and programmed cell death or apoptosis. In
                 addition to serving as a source of cellular signals,
                 the endoplasmic reticulum is also functionally and
                 structurally modified by the Ca2+ and protein kinase C
                 pathways. Elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ causes a
                 rearrangement and fragmentation of endoplasmic
                 reticulum membranes. Protein kinase C activation
                 reduces the storage capacity of the endoplasmic
                 reticulum Ca2+ pool. In some cell types, protein kinase
                 C inhibits capacitative calcium entry. Protein kinase C
                 activation also protects the endoplasmic reticulum from
                 the structural effects of high cytoplasmic Ca2+. The
                 emerging view is one of a complex network of pathways
                 through which the endoplasmic reticulum and the Ca2+
                 and protein kinase C signaling pathways interact at
                 various levels regulating cellular structure and
                 function. [References: 166]",

                 161-173, 1992). SR vesicles from invertebrate muscle
                 exhibited specific ryanodine binding and single channel
                 currents that were activated by Ca2+, caffeine, and ATP
                 and inhibited by ruthenium red. The single channel
                 conductance of this invertebrate RyR was lower than
                 that of the vertebrate RyR (49 and 102 pS,

                 family of Ca2+ release channels is central to
                 intracellular Ca2+ signaling in mammalian cells. The
                 InsP3R channels release Ca2+ from intracellular
                 compartments to generate localized Ca2+ transients that
                 govern a myriad of cellular signaling phenomena (.
                 Nature. 361:315-325; . Cell Signal. 8:1-7; . Science.
                 278:1940-1943; . Nature. 368:759-760). Most cells
                 express multiple InsP3R isoforms, but only the function
                 of the single type 1 InsP3R channel is known. Here the
                 single-channel function of single type 2 InsP3R channel
                 is defined for the first time. The type 2 InsP3R forms
                 channels with permeation properties similar to that of
                 the type 1 receptor. The InsP3 regulation and Ca2+
                 regulation of type 1 and type 2 InsP3R channels are
                 strikingly different. Both InsP3 and Ca2+ are more
                 effective at activating single type 2 InsP3R,
                 indicating that single type 2 channels mobilize
                 substantially more Ca2+ than single type 1 channels in
                 cells. Furthermore, high cytoplasmic Ca2+
                 concentrations inactivate type 1, but not type 2,
                 InsP3R channels. This indicates that type 2 InsP3R
                 channel is different from the type 1 channel in that
                 its activity will not be inherently self-limiting,
                 because Ca2+ passing through an active type 2 channel
                 cannot feed back and turn the channel off. Thus the
                 InsP3R identity will help define the spatial and
                 temporal nature of local Ca2+ signaling events and may
                 contribute to the segregation of parallel InsP3
                 signaling cascades in mammalian cells.",

                 different high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channel current
                 components were distinguished pharmacologically.
                 Nimodipine-sensitive L-type current and
                 omega-CTx-GVIA-sensitive N-type current contributed 15
                 and 20\% of the total current, respectively. The bulk
                 of the remaining current (46\%) was inhibited by
                 omega-Aga-IVA. The current blocked by this toxin was
                 further subdivided into two components, P-type and
                 Q-type, on the basis of differences in their
                 inactivation kinetics and sensitivity to omega-Aga-IVA.
                 P-Type current was noninactivating during 0.1 sec
                 depolarizations, half-blocked at about 1-3 nM
                 omega-Aga-IVA, and contributed approximately 11\% of
                 the total current; Q-type current was prominently
                 inactivating, half-blocked at approximately 90 nM
                 omega-Aga-IVA, and comprised 35\% of the total current.
                 Both P- and Q-type currents were potently inhibited by
                 the Conus magus toxin omega-CTx-MVIIC. A current
                 component resistant to all of the aforementioned
                 blockers (R-type) displayed more rapid inactivation
                 than the other components and constituted 19\% of the
                 total current. The Q-type current, the largest of the
                 current components in the granule neurons, resembles

                 transverse cell axis versus the longitudinal axis (p <

                 the percentage change in threshold was observed to

                 investigate the distribution of the transmembrane
                 potential of these experimentally studied myocytes. A
                 typical cell model showed that the maximum

                 cell was 39.1 mV and -46.5 mV for longitudinal field

                 short axis of the cell). More significantly, it was
                 found that the maximum transmembrane potential occurred
                 at discrete points or hot spots on the cell membrane.
                 It is hypothesized that the depolarization of the cell
                 initiates at the hot spot and then spreads over the
                 entire cell. The different excitation thresholds for
                 different polarities of the applied EF can be explained
                 by the different maximum induced at the opposite ends

                 cellular behavior and failure. These networks are
                 composed of hundreds to thousands of chemical species
                 and structures, interacting via nonlinear and possibly
                 stochastic physical processes. A central goal of modern
                 biology is to optimally use the data on these networks
                 to understand how their design leads to the observed
                 cellular behaviors and failures. Ultimately, this
                 knowledge should enable cellular engineers to redesign
                 cellular processes to meet industrial needs (such as
                 optimal natural product synthesis), aid in choosing the
                 most effective targets for pharmaceuticals, and tailor

                 slices were physiologically characterized using
                 intracellular techniques. Extracellular caesium ions
                 were used to linearize the membrane properties of PCs
                 near the resting potential. Under these conditions the
                 average input resistance, R(N), was 29 M Omega, the
                 average system time constant, tau(0), was 82 ms and the
                 average cable length, L(N), was 0.59. 2. Three PCs were
                 fully reconstructed following physiological
                 measurements and staining with horseradish peroxidase.
                 Assuming that each spine has an area of 1 mu m(2) and
                 that the spine density over the spiny dendrites is ten
                 spines per micrometre length, the total membrane area
                 of each PC is similar to 150000 mu m(2), of which
                 similar to 100000 mu m(2) is in the spines. 3. Detailed
                 passive cable and compartmental models were built for
                 each of the three reconstructed PCs. Computational
                 methods were devised to incorporate globally the huge
                 number of spines into these models. In all three cells
                 the models predict that the specific membrane
                 resistivity, R(m), of the soma is much lower than the
                 dendritic R(m) (similar to 500 and similar to 100000
                 Omega cm(2) respectively). The specific membrane
                 capacitance, C-m, is estimated to be 1.5-2 mu F cm(-2)
                 and the specific cytoplasm resistivity, R(i), is 250
                 Omega cm. 4. The average cable length of the dendrites
                 according to the model is 0.13 lambda, suggesting that
                 under caesium conditions PCs are electrically very
                 compact. Brief somatic spikes, however, are expected to
                 attenuate 30-fold when spreading passively into the
                 dendritic terminals. A simulated 200 Hz train of fast,
                 90 mV somatic spikes produced a smooth 12 mV steady
                 depolarization at the dendritic terminals. 5. A
                 transient synaptic conductance increase, with a 1 nS
                 peak at 0.5 ms and a driving force of 60 mV, is
                 expected to produce similar to 20 mV peak
                 depolarization at the spine head membrane. This EPSP
                 then attenuates between 200- and 900-fold into the
                 soma. Approximately 800 randomly distributed and
                 synchronously activated spiny inputs are required to
                 fire the soma. 6. The passive model of the PC predicts
                 a poor resolution of the spatio-temporal pattern of the
                 parallel fibre input. An equally sized, randomly
                 distributed group of similar to 1\% of the parallel
                 fibres, activated within a time window of a few
                 milliseconds, would result in approximately the same
                 composite EPSP at the soma.",

                 subtypes beta, gamma, and delta comprise a related
                 group of multidomain phosphodiesterases that cleave the
                 polar head groups from inositol lipids. Activated by
                 all classes of cell surface receptor, these enzymes
                 generate the ubiquitous second messengers inositol 1,4,
                 5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. The last 5 years
                 have seen remarkable advances in our understanding of
                 the molecular and biological facets of PLCs. New
                 insights into their multidomain arrangement and
                 catalytic mechanism have been gained from
                 crystallographic studies of PLC-delta(1), while new
                 modes of controlling PLC activity have been uncovered
                 in cellular studies. Most notable is the realization
                 that PLC-beta, -gamma, and -delta isoforms act in
                 concert, each contributing to a specific aspect of the
                 cellular response. Clues to their true biological roles
                 were also obtained. Long assumed to function broadly in
                 calcium-regulated processes, genetic studies in yeast,
                 slime molds, plants, flies, and mammals point to
                 specific and conditional roles for each PLC isoform in
                 cell signaling and development. In this review we
                 consider each subtype of PLC in organisms ranging from
                 yeast to mammals and discuss their molecular regulation
                 and biological function.",

                 phospholipase C (PLC), which are grouped into four
                 subfamilies (beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon), have
                 been identified in mammals. These isozymes catalyze the
                 hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
                 [PtdIns(4,5)P2] to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and
                 diacylglycerol in response to the activation of more
                 than 100 different cell surface receptors. All PLC
                 isoforms contain X and Y domains, which form the
                 catalytic core, as well as various combinations of
                 regulatory domains that are common to many other
                 signaling proteins. These regulatory domains serve to
                 target PLC isozymes to the vicinity of their substrate
                 or activators through protein-protein or protein-lipid
                 interactions. These domains (with their binding
                 partners in parentheses or brackets) include the
                 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain [PtdIns(3)P, beta gamma
                 subunits of G proteins] and the COOH-terminal region
                 including the C2 domain (GTP-bound alpha subunit of Gq)
                 of PLC-beta; the PH domain [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] and Src
                 homology 2 domain [tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins,
                 PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] of PLC-gamma; the PH domain

                 the Ras binding domain (GTP-bound Ras) of PLC-epsilon.
                 The presence of distinct regulatory domains in PLC
                 isoforms renders them susceptible to different modes of
                 activation. Given that the partners that interact with
                 these regulatory domains of PLC isozymes are generated
                 or eliminated in specific regions of the cell in
                 response to changes in receptor status, the activation
                 and deactivation of each PLC isoform are likely highly

                 13-acetate (PMA) reduced the release of Ca2+ by
                 thapsigargin, but did not activate Ca2+ entry; Ca2+
                 influx was triggered after the residual pool was
                 emptied by thapsigargin, and this Ca2+ influx was
                 similar to that induced by thapsigargin in control
                 cells. The effect of PMA was due to decreased Ca2+
                 storage because 1) Ca2+ release by ionomycin was
                 similarly affected by PMA, and in both control and
                 PMA-treated cells, ionomycin did not release Ca2+
                 following thapsigargin treatment; 2) PMA reduced 45Ca2+
                 accumulation; and 3) studies with Ca2+ indicator
                 compartmentalized into the endoplasmic reticulum
                 indicated that stored Ca2+ was reduced by PMA. Although
                 PMA did not itself activate Ca2+ entry, PMA potentiated
                 Ca2+ entry with low concentrations of cyclopiazonic
                 acid. With a somewhat higher concentration of
                 cyclopiazonic acid, PMA had no effect on calcium entry.
                 Thus, protein kinase C has two apparent actions on
                 calcium signaling in NIH 3T3 cells: 1) reduced
                 intracellular Ca2+ storage capacity and 2) augmented
                 calcium entry with submaximal intracellular Ca2+ pool

                 most of the biologically useful energy. However, oxygen
                 reduction is a mixed blessing because incompletely
                 reduced oxygen species such as superoxide or peroxides
                 are quite reactive and can, when out of control, cause
                 damage. In mitochondria, where most of the oxygen
                 utilized by eukaryotic cells is reduced, the dichotomy
                 of oxygen shows itself best. Thus, reactive oxygen is a
                 threat to them, as is evident from oxidative damage to
                 mitochondrial lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.
                 Reactive oxygen, in the form of peroxides, also serves
                 useful functions in mitochondria. This is exemplified
                 by the control of mitochondrial and cellular calcium
                 homeostasis, whose understanding has improved greatly
                 during the last few years. An exciting new aspect is
                 the discovery that nitric oxide and congeners have an
                 enormous impact on mitochondria. Physiological
                 concentrations of nitrogen monoxide (NO) at
                 physiological cellular oxygen pressure inhibit
                 cytochrome oxidase and thereby respiration. A transient
                 inhibition of cytochrome oxidase by NO appears to be
                 used in at least some forms of cell signalling.
                 Peroxynitrite, the product of the reaction between
                 superoxide and NO, can stimulate the specific calcium
                 release pathway from mitochondria by oxidizing some
                 vicinal thiols in mitochondria. There is evidence
                 mounting that mitochondrial calcium handling and its
                 modulation by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species is
                 important for necrotic and apoptotic cell death.

                 cardiac muscle consisting of one dihydropyridine
                 receptor (DHPR) and eight ryanodine receptor (RyR)
                 channels, and the volume surrounding them, is
                 formulated. It is assumed that no spatial [Ca2+]
                 gradients exist in this volume, and that each FRU acts
                 independently. The model is amenable to systematic
                 parameter studies in which FRU dynamics are simulated
                 at the channel level using Monte Carlo methods with
                 Ca2+ concentrations simulated by numerical integration
                 of a coupled system of differential equations. Using
                 stochastic methods, Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR)
                 shows both high gain and graded Ca2+ release that is
                 robust when parameters are varied. For a single DHPR
                 opening, the resulting RyR Ca2+ release flux is
                 insensitive to the DHPR open duration, and is
                 determined principally by local sarcoplasmic reticulum
                 (SR) Ca2+ load, consistent with experimental data on
                 Ca2+ sparks. In addition, single RyR openings are
                 effective in triggering Ca2+ release from adjacent RyRs
                 only when open duration is long and SR Ca2+ load is
                 high. This indicates relatively low coupling between
                 RyRs, and suggests a mechanism that limits the
                 regenerative spread of RyR openings. The results also
                 suggest that adaptation plays an important modulatory
                 role in shaping Ca2+ release duration and magnitude,
                 but is not solely responsible for terminating Ca2+
                 release. Results obtained with the stochastic model
                 suggest that high gain and gradedness can occur by the
                 recruitment of independent FRUs without requiring
                 spatial [Ca2+] gradients within a functional unit or
                 cross-coupling between adjacent functional units.",

                 mitochondria are endowed with a complex array of Ca2+
                 transporters and that key enzymes of mitochondrial
                 metabolism are regulated by Ca2+, the possibility that
                 physiological stimuli that raise the [Ca2+] of the
                 cytoplasm could trigger major mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake
                 has long been considered unlikely, based on the low
                 affinity of the mitochondrial transporters and the
                 limited amplitude of the cytoplasmic [Ca2+] rises. The
                 direct measurement of mitochondrial [Ca2+] with highly
                 selective probes has led to a complete reversion of
                 this view, by demonstrating that, after cell
                 stimulation, the cytoplasmic Ca2+ signal is always
                 paralleled by a much larger rise in [Ca2+] in the
                 mitochondrial matrix. This observation has rejuvenated

                 the field of calcium signalling. Here we focus on four
                 main topics: (i) the current knowledge of the
                 functional properties of the Ca2+ transporters and of
                 the thermodynamic constraints under which they operate;
                 (ii) the occurrence of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in
                 living cells and the key role of local signalling
                 routes between the mitochondria and the Ca2+ sources;
                 (iii) the physiological consequences of Ca2+ transport
                 for both mitochondrial function and the modulation of
                 the cytoplasmic Ca2+ signal; and (iv) evidence that
                 alterations of mitochondrial Ca2+ signalling may occur
                 in pathophysiological conditions. [References: 63]",

                 proper placement of the components of the organism.
                 Likewise, pathogens that invade other organisms rely on
                 directional signals to target vulnerable areas. It is
                 widely understood that chemical gradients are important
                 directional signals in living systems. Less well
                 recognized are electrical fields, which can also
                 provide directional information. Small, steady
                 electrical fields can directly guide cell movement and
                 growth and can generate chemical gradients of charged
                 macromolecules against the leveling action of
                 diffusion. At the site of a lesion in an
                 ion-transporting epithelium, for example, a substantial
                 electrical field is instantly generated and may extend

                 activates a Ca(2+)-dependent K+ conductance, producing
                 an outward current, and it inhibits a voltage-dependent
                 K+ conductance (the M conductance), thus diminishing
                 the M-type voltage-dependent K+ current (IK(M)) and
                 producing an inward current. The present experiments
                 were undertaken to find out how far inhibition of IK(M)
                 might be secondary to stimulation of phospholipase C,

                 reversibly inhibited IK(M) by 47.3 +/- 3.2\% (n = 23).
                 Following pressure-application of 1 mM ACh, the mean
                 latency to inhibition was 420 ms at 35 degrees C and
                 1.79 s at 23 degrees C. Latencies to inhibition by Ba2+
                 ions were 148 ms at 35 degrees C and 92 ms at 23
                 degrees C. 3. The involvement of a G-protein was tested
                 by adding 0.5 mM GTP-gamma-S or 10 mM potassium
                 fluoride to the pipette solution. These slowly reduced
                 IK(M), with half-times of about 30 and 20 min
                 respectively, and rendered the effect of superimposed
                 ACh irreversible. Effects of ACh were not significantly

                 pertussis toxin or on adding up to 10 mM GDP-beta-S to
                 the pipette solution. 4. The role of phospholipase C
                 and its products was tested using neomycin (to inhibit
                 phospholipase C), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)
                 and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (InsP4),
                 heparin, and phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) and staurosporin
                 (to activate and inhibit protein kinase C
                 respectively). Both neomycin (1 mM external) and InsP3
                 (100 microM intrapipette) inhibited the ACh-induced
                 outward current and/or intracellular Ca2+ transient but
                 did not block ACh-induced inhibition of IK(M).
                 Intrapipette heparin (1 mM) blocked activation of
                 IK(Ca) and reduced Ach-induced inhibitions of IK(M),

                 Ca2+ release, such that increases in cytosolic free
                 Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) from either internal Ca2+ stores or Ca2+
                 influx across the plasma membrane can be rapidly
                 transported into the mitochondrial matrix. The
                 consequent elevation in mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m)
                 stimulates the Ca2+-sensitive intramitochondrial
                 dehydrogenases, resulting in elevation of NAD(P)H. The
                 preferential coupling between increases in [Ca2+]c and
                 [Ca2+]m is one proposed mechanism to coordinate
                 mitochondrial ATP production with cellular energy
                 demand. In liver cells, hormones that act through the
                 second messenger inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3)
                 generate oscillatory [Ca2+]c signals, which result from
                 a periodic Ca2+- and IP3-mediated
                 activation/deactivation of intracellular Ca2+ release
                 channels. The [Ca2+]c spiking frequency increases with
                 agonist dose, whereas the amplitude of each [Ca2+]c
                 spike is constant. This frequency modulation of [Ca2+]c
                 spiking encodes the signal from the extracellular
                 agonist, which is then decoded by the internal
                 Ca2+-sensitive proteins such as the Ca2+-sensitive
                 intramitochondrial dehydrogenases. Our studies have
                 investigated the relationship between IP3-dependent
                 [Ca2+]c signals and [Ca2+]m in primary cultured
                 hepatocytes. In addition, the changes in cellular
                 [Ca2+] levels have been correlated with the regulation

                 chaperones that participate in protein folding in the
                 endoplasmic reticulum (ER). CRT is a soluble ER lumenal
                 protein, whereas CLNX is a transmembrane protein with a
                 cytosolic domain that contains two consensus motifs for
                 protein kinase (PK) C/proline- directed kinase (PDK)
                 phosphorylation. Using confocal Ca(2+) imaging in
                 Xenopus oocytes, we report here that coexpression of
                 CLNX with sarco endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase
                 (SERCA) 2b results in inhibition of intracellular
                 Ca(2+) oscillations, suggesting a functional inhibition
                 of the pump. By site-directed mutagenesis, we
                 demonstrate that this interaction is regulated by a
                 COOH-terminal serine residue (S562) in CLNX.
                 Furthermore, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate- mediated
                 Ca(2+) release results in a dephosphorylation of this
                 residue. We also demonstrate by coimmunoprecipitation
                 that CLNX physically interacts with the COOH terminus
                 of SERCA2b and that after dephosphorylation treatment,
                 this interaction is significantly reduced. Together,
                 our results suggest that CRT is uniquely regulated by
                 ER lumenal conditions, whereas CLNX is, in addition,
                 regulated by the phosphorylation status of its
                 cytosolic domain. The S562 residue in CLNX acts as a

                 voltage between two microchannel plates(MCP's) in a
                 tandem configuration has been investigated. It was
                 found that increasing the voltage in the gap increased
                 the gain of the pair and also produce a narrower
                 Gaussian pulse-height distribution. Beyond a critical
                 voltage the gain of the channel pair was found to
                 plateau. These observations can be explained in terms
                 of a model involving both the nonlinear gain behavior
                 of individual microchannels and the behavior of the
                 electron cloud emitted from the first MCP as it spreads
                 out between the two MCP's and hits the surface of the
                 second. From this model the plateau voltage is
                 calculated as a function of the gap size, the gain of
                 each MCP, and the diameter of the channels, and is
                 found to match the observed results. It is concluded

                 be accomodated without significant degradation in

                 Angiotensin II (AII; 1 nM) induced a higher amplitude
                 NAD(P)H response than K+ (5.6-7.6 mM). Vasopressin (1

                 the dynamical behavior of gene regulation networks.
                 Current approaches aim at determining the network
                 structure based on genomic-scale data. However, the
                 network connectivity alone is not sufficient to define
                 its dynamics; one needs to also specify the kinetic
                 parameters for the regulation reactions. Here, we ask
                 whether effective kinetic parameters can be assigned to
                 a transcriptional network based on expression data. We
                 present a combined experimental and theoretical
                 approach based on accurate high temporal-resolution
                 measurement of promoter activities from living cells by
                 using green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter
                 plasmids. We present algorithms that use these data to
                 assign effective kinetic parameters within a
                 mathematical model of the network. To demonstrate this,
                 we employ a well defined network, the SOS DNA repair
                 system of Escherichia coli. We find a strikingly
                 detailed temporal program of expression that correlates
                 with the functional role of the SOS genes and is driven
                 by a hierarchy of effective kinetic parameter strengths
                 for the various promoters. The calculated parameters
                 can be used to determine the kinetics of all SOS genes
                 given the expression profile of just one
                 representative, allowing a significant reduction in
                 complexity. The concentration profile of the master SOS
                 transcriptional repressor can be calculated,
                 demonstrating that relative protein levels may be
                 determined from purely transcriptional data. This
                 finding opens the possibility of assigning kinetic
                 parameters to transcriptional networks on a genomic

                 non-mitochondrial intracellular store. Many studies
                 have indirectly suggested the endoplasmic reticulum
                 (ER) to be the site of InsP3 action, though some have
                 implicated the plasma membrane or a newly described
                 smooth surfaced structure, termed the calciosome. Using
                 antibodies directed against a purified InsP3-receptor

                 InsP3-induced intracellular calcium release is not the
                 property of a single organelle, but is effected by
                 specialized portions of both rough and smooth ER, and
                 possibly by other smooth surfaced structures. The

                 roles of electrons and nuclei, is generalized to D
                 dimensions. For H2+ itself there exist myriad exact
                 interdimensional degeneracies because D->D+2 is
                 equivalent to m-> m+1, augmenting by unity the
                 projection of the electronic angular momentum on the
                 internuclear axis. When the molecular orbitals (MO's)
                 are transcribed to treat two-electron motion,
                 additional constraints limit the exact degeneracies to
                 states in D=3 and 5, but many approximates degeneracies

                 dimension and angular momentum is a pervasive feature.

                 recordings were made from Purkinje cells in cerebellar
                 slices from 12- to 21-day-old rats. Voltage responses
                 to current impulses injected via either the dendritic
                 or the somatic pipette were obtained in the presence of
                 the selective I(h) blocker ZD 7288 and blockers of
                 spontaneous synaptic input. Neurons were filled with
                 biocytin for subsequent morphological reconstruction.
                 2. Four neurons were reconstructed and converted into
                 detailed compartmental models. The specific membrane
                 capacitance (C(m)), specific membrane resistance (R(m))
                 and intracellular resistivity (R(i)) were optimized by
                 direct fitting of the model responses to the
                 electrophysiological data from the same cell. Mean
                 values were: C(m), 0.77 +/- 0.17 &mgr;F cm(-2) (mean
                 +/- S.D.; range, 0.64-1.00 &mgr;F cm(-2)), R(m), 122
                 +/- 18 kOmega cm(2) (98-141 kOmega cm(2)) and R(i), 115
                 +/- 20 Omega cm (93-142 Omega cm). 3. The steady-state
                 electrotonic architecture of these cells was compact
                 under the experimental conditions used. However,
                 somatic voltage-clamp recordings of parallel fibre and
                 climbing fibre synaptic currents were substantially
                 filtered and attenuated. 4. The detailed models were
                 compared with a two-compartment model of Purkinje
                 cells. The range of synaptic current kinetics that can
                 be faithfully recorded using somatic voltage clamp is
                 predicted fairly well by the two-compartment model,
                 even though some of its underlying assumptions are
                 violated. 5. A model of I(h) was constructed based on
                 voltage-clamp data, and inserted into the passive
                 compartmental models. Somatic EPSP amplitude was
                 substantially attenuated compared to the amplitude of
                 dendritic EPSPs at their site of generation. However,
                 synaptic efficacy of the same quantal synaptic
                 conductance, as measured by the somatic EPSP amplitude,
                 was only weakly dependent on synaptic location on spiny
                 branchlets. 6. The passive electrotonic structure of
                 Purkinje cells is unusual in that the steady-state
                 architecture is very compact, while voltage transients
                 such as synaptic potentials and action potentials are
                 heavily filtered.",

                 mitochondria in signaling, cell injury and cell death,
                 there is a need for a convenient, sensitive and
                 accurate method for the measurement of the
                 mitochondrial membrane potential, Deltapsim, in situ,
                 in a heterogeneous cell population. We have adapted a
                 flow cytometry method for the quantitative measurement
                 of DeltaPsim which utilizes the lipophilic, cationic,
                 fluorescent probe 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide
                 (DiOC6(3)). We developed a new protocol in which cells
                 are equilibrated with very low dye concentrations (<1
                 nM). Only under these condition, the cell fluorescence
                 appears to be correlated with the magnitude of
                 DeltaPsim, as evident from the sensitivity of the
                 fluorescence to low concentrations of uncouplers,
                 ionophores and inhibitors of the mitochondrial proton
                 pumps. The magnitude of the plasma membrane potential,
                 DeltaPsip, also affects cell fluorescence, and a
                 procedure that corrects for this effect is outlined.
                 This method offers a distinct advantage over existing

  abstract =     "The broad aim of this work was to explore the
                 feasibility of using light-directed perturbation
                 techniques to study cell locomotion. Specifically, a
                 caged form of thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4) was
                 photoactivated in a defined local region of locomoting
                 fish scale keratocytes and the resulting perturbation
                 of locomotion was studied. Purified Tbeta4 was produced
                 in an inactive form by caging with
                 ([n-nitroveratryl]oxy)chlorocarbamate. In vitro
                 spectrophotofluorometric assays indicated that caged
                 Tbeta4 did not change the normal actin polymerization
                 kinetics, whereas photoactivated Tbeta4 significantly
                 inhibited actin polymerization. With an a priori
                 knowledge of the cytoplasmic diffusion coefficient of
                 Tbeta4 as measured by fluorescence recovery after
                 photobleaching experiments, the rapid sequestration of
                 actin monomers by uncaged Tbeta4 and the consequent
                 reduction in the diffusional spread of the Tbeta4-actin
                 complex were predicted using Virtual Cell software
                 (developed at the Center for Biomedical Imaging
                 Technology, University of Connecticut Health Center).
                 These simulations demonstrated that locally
                 photoactivating Tbeta4 in keratocytes could potentially
                 elicit a regional locomotory response. Indeed, when
                 caged Tbeta4 was locally photoactivated at the wings of
                 locomoting keratocytes, specific turning about the
                 irradiated region was observed, whereas various
                 controls were negative. Additionally, loading of
                 exogenous Tbeta4 into both keratocytes and fibroblasts
                 caused very rapid disassembly of actin filaments and
                 reduction of cellular contractility. Based on these
                 results, a mechanical model is proposed for the turning
                 behavior of keratocytes in response to photoreleased
                 Tbeta4.",

                 and voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCCs)--triggers
                 diverse processes that underlie synaptic plasticity.
                 Using two-photon laser scanning microscopy, we imaged
                 action-potential-induced transient changes in Ca2+
                 concentration in spines and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal
                 neurons in rat hippocampal slices. Through analysis of
                 the large trial-to-trial fluctuations in these
                 transients, we have determined the number and
                 properties of VSCCs in single spines. Here we report
                 that each spine contains 1-20 VSCCs, and that this

                 spines to approximately 0.3 but had no effect on VSCCs

                 Hz magnetic fields has been considered to support an
                 association between exposure to magnetic fields and
                 cancer risk. Several reports have indicated that these
                 fields rapidly activate many genes in mammalian cells.
                 However, previous studies in this area have not
                 provided sufficient information to support the
                 conclusions drawn. To clarify this controversial
                 research, we have attempted to validate, under
                 rigorously controlled conditions, key experiments on
                 induction of gene expression by magnetic fields. An
                 extensive series of experiments, incorporating critical
                 improvements in experimental design, most notably blind
                 exposures and internal standards, was performed with
                 human HL60 and Daudi cells. Exposure conditions covered
                 a range of flux densities (5.7 microT to 10 mT) and
                 times (20-60 min). No alteration in the human MYC gene,
                 commonly referred to as c-myc, or beta-actin
                 steady-state mRNA levels was observed. The lack of an
                 effect was not attributable to exposure geometry,
                 timing of RNA preparation, or serum lot and
                 concentration. To eliminate any remaining variables,
                 exact replication was performed in one of the
                 laboratories previously reporting gene expression
                 effects; again, no evidence for altered MYC expression
                 was found. Finally, differential display PCR indicated
                 that extremely low-frequency magnetic field-induced
                 changes in gene expression were not prevalent.",

                 spectra and quenching of the fluorescence intensity
                 were observed. The absorbance difference at 730 minus
                 685 nm, or at 730 minus 800 nm, and the fluorescence
                 intensity measured at 692 nm varied linearly with the
                 mitochondrial membrane potential. The spectral changes
                 observed could be explained in terms of the
                 potential-dependent uptake of the dye from the buffer
                 solution into the mitochondrial matrix. The respiration
                 control ratio and oxygen consumption rate were not
                 affected by the addition of Rhodamine 800 at
                 concentrations lower than 5 microM, which was the
                 concentration range mostly employed throughout the
                 present study. In a suspension of hepatocytes, the red
                 shift and fluorescence quenching of Rhodamine 800
                 characteristic of energized mitochondria were also
                 observed, and these changed to those of the buffer
                 solution with the addition of an uncoupler under
                 normoxia. At the early stage of anoxia, within about 5
                 min, when cytochrome oxidase was completely reduced,
                 hepatocytes were concluded to be in the fully energized
                 state, since the optical characteristics of Rhodamine
                 800 were the same as those of energized mitochondria.
                 On the basis of these in vitro data, Rhodamine 800 is
                 concluded to be a possible NIR-active contrast agent,
                 that can be used to monitor the energy states of living
                 tissues, in addition to the tissue oxygenation states,
                 by the use of near-infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS)
                 without harmful effects.",

                 by which local elevations of intracellular calcium
                 (Ca2+) are amplified by Ca2+ release from
                 ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores. CICR is known to be
                 coupled to Ca2+ entry in skeletal muscle, cardiac
                 muscle, and peripheral neurons, but no evidence
                 suggests that such coupling occurs in central neurons
                 during the firing of action potentials. Using fast Ca2+
                 imaging in CA1 neurons from hippocampal slices, we
                 found evidence for CICR during action potential-evoked
                 Ca2+ transients. A low concentration of caffeine
                 enhanced Ca2+ transient amplitude, whereas a higher
                 concentration reduced it. Simultaneous Ca2+ imaging and
                 whole-cell recordings showed that membrane potential,
                 action potential amplitude, and waveform were unchanged
                 during caffeine application. The enhancement of Ca2+
                 transients by caffeine was not affected by the L-type
                 channel blocker nifedipine, the phosphodiesterase
                 inhibitor IBMX, the adenylyl cyclase activator
                 forskolin, or the PKA antagonist H-89. However,
                 thapsigargin or ryanodine, which both empty
                 intracellular Ca2+ stores, occluded this effect. In
                 addition, thapsigargin, ryanodine, and cyclopiazonic
                 acid reduced action potential-evoked Ca2+ transients in
                 the absence of caffeine. These results suggest that
                 Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive stores

                 potentials in CA1 neurons.",

                 receptor-stimulated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol
                 4,5-bisphosphate, is mediated by binding to
                 intracellular receptors, which are expressed in high
                 concentration in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Partially
                 conflicting previous reports localized the receptor to
                 various subcellular structures: elements of ER, both
                 rough and smooth-surfaced, the nuclear envelope, and
                 even the plasma membrane. We have now reinvestigated
                 the problem quantitatively by using cryosections of rat
                 cerebellar tissue immunolabeled with polyclonal
                 monospecific antibodies against the inositol
                 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. By immunofluorescence the
                 receptor was detected only in Purkinje cells, whereas
                 the other cells of the cerebellar cortex remained
                 negative. In immunogold-decorated ultrathin
                 cryosections of the Purkinje cell body, the receptor
                 was concentrated in cisternal stacks (piles of up to 12
                 parallel cisternae separated by regularly spaced
                 bridges, located both in the deep cytoplasm and beneath
                 the plasma membrane; average density, greater than 5
                 particles/micron of membrane profile); in cisternal
                 singlets and doublets adjacent to the plasma membrane
                 (average density, approximately 2.5 particles/micron);
                 and in other apparently smooth-surfaced vesicular and
                 tubular profiles. Additional smooth-surfaced elements
                 were unlabeled. Perinuclear and rough-surfaced ER
                 cisternae were labeled much less by themselves
                 (approximately 0.5 particles/micron, two- to threefold
                 the background), but were often in direct membrane
                 continuity with heavily labeled, smooth-surfaced
                 tubules and cisternal stacks. Finally, mitochondria,
                 Golgi cisternae, multivesicular bodies, and the plasma
                 membrane were unlabeled. In dendrites, approximately
                 half of the nonmitochondrial, membrane-bound structures
                 (cisternae, tubules, and vesicles), as well as small
                 cisternal stacks, were labeled. Dendritic spines always
                 contained immunolabeled cisternae and vesicles. The
                 dendritic plasma membrane, of both shaft and spines,
                 was consistently unlabeled. These results identify a
                 large, smooth-surfaced ER subcompartment that appears
                 equipped to play a key role in the control of Ca2+
                 homeostasis: in particular, in the generation of
                 [Ca2+]i transients triggered by activation of specific

                 of cell/substrate contacts through receptor/ligand
                 bonds in series is explored with a simple mathematical
                 model and quantified with an experimental adhesion
                 assay. A deterministic, mass-action model is developed
                 to describe the attachment and detachment of
                 cell/substrate contacts through single and serial
                 bonds. The experimental system is comprised of
                 protein-coated beads, soluble antibody linkers, and an
                 antibody-coated glass surface. Using the Radial-Flow
                 Detachment Assay, the adhesion strengths of
                 bead/substrate contacts through single and serial
                 linkages are measured. Taken together, this work shows
                 that the specific adhesion strength of the
                 cell/substrate contacts comprised of two
                 receptor/ligand bonds in series is less than the
                 specific adhesion strength of the cell/substrate
                 contacts comprised of either of the bonds separately.
                 In addition, the force to rupture contacts comprised of
                 bonds in series varies with the concentration of the
                 solution linker. The model predicts that the locus of
                 linkage fracture location has only a mild dependence on
                 the ratio of relative bond affinities. [References:

                 compiler. SCAMP accepts metabolic models described in a
                 biochemical language, and this enables novice as well
                 as experienced users rapidly to build and simulate
                 metabolic systems. The language is sufficiently
                 flexible to enable other types of model to be built,
                 e.g. chemostat or ecological models. The language
                 offers many facilities, including: the ability to
                 describe metabolic pathways of any structure and
                 possessing any kinetics using normal chemical notation;
                 optionally build models directly from the differential
                 equations; differing compartment volumes; access to
                 flux, concentration and rate of change information;
                 detection of conserved cycles; access to all
                 coefficients and elasticities of metabolic control
                 analysis; user-defined forcing functions at the model
                 boundaries; user-defined monitoring functions;
                 user-configurable output of any quantity. From the
                 model description SCAMP can either generate C code for

                 stand-alone models or run-time code for input to a

                 resolution, live dissociated neurons stained with the
                 voltage sensitive dye RH237. We demonstrate with a
                 theoretical approach that the spatial patterns in the
                 images result from the distribution of net positive
                 charges condensed in the inner sites of the membrane
                 where clusters of open ionic channels are located. We
                 observed that, in our biological images, this spatial
                 distribution of open channels varies randomly from
                 trial to trial while the action potentials recorded by
                 the microelectrode display similar amplitudes and
                 time-courses. The random differences in size and
                 intensity of the spatial patterns in the images are
                 best evidenced when the time of observation coincides
                 with the duration of single action potentials. This
                 spatial variability is explained by the fact that only
                 part of the channel population generates an action
                 potential and that different channels open in turn in
                 different trials due to their stochastic operation.
                 Such spatial flicker modifies the direction of lateral
                 current along the neuronal membrane and may have

                 provide a new microscopic picture of neuronal
                 excitation. This is the first attempt to combine
                 imaging of active channel clusters on the geometry of
                 live neurons and a theoretical approach. During single
                 somatic action potentials and the back-invasion into
                 the neurites, local mean potentials are generated at
                 sites of active channel clusters which are unevenly
                 distributed in the neuronal membrane. Similar mean
                 membrane potentials are observed in the neurites and at
                 the soma. Identical action potentials produce different
                 spatial patterns of mean membrane potentials from trial
                 to trial. This spatial variability is explained by the
                 stochastic behavior of the channels in the clusters.
                 When hippocampal neurons are excited by synaptic
                 inputs, their evoked responses are probabilistic and
                 generate variable spatial patterns of mean membrane
                 potential trial after trial. Our stochastic model
                 reproduces this random behavior by assuming that the
                 voltage fluctuations generated by channel noise are
                 added to the synaptic potentials reaching the soma. We
                 demonstrate that the probability of action potential
                 initiation depends on the strength of the synaptic
                 input, the diameter of the dendrites and the relative

                 probes to monitor the membrane potential of
                 mitochondria. These indicator dyes are lipophilic
                 cations accumulated by mitochondria in proportion to
                 DeltaPsi. Upon accumulation, all three dyes exhibit a
                 red shift in both their absorption and fluorescence
                 emission spectra. The fluorescence intensity is
                 quenched when the dyes are accumulated by mitochondria.
                 These properties have been used to develop a method to
                 dynamically monitor DeltaPsi of isolated rat heart
                 mitochondria using a ratio fluorescence approach. All
                 three dyes bound to the inner and outer aspects of the
                 inner mitochondrial membrane and, as a result, were
                 accumulated by mitochondria in a greater quantity than
                 predicted by the Nernst equation. Binding to
                 mitochondria was temperature-dependent and the degree
                 of binding was in the order of TMRE > R123 > TMRM. The
                 internal and external partition coefficients for
                 binding were determined to correct for binding in the
                 calculation of DeltaPsi. All three dyes suppressed
                 mitochondrial respiratory control to some extent.
                 Inhibition of respiration was greatest with TMRE,
                 followed by R123 and TMRM. When used at low
                 concentrations, TMRM did not suppress respiration. The
                 use of these dyes and ratio fluorescence techniques
                 affords a simple method for measurement of DeltaPsi of
                 isolated mitochondria. We also applied this approach to
                 the isolated perfused heart to determine whether
                 DeltaPsi could be monitored in an intact tissue.

                 heart under various conditions after accumulation of
                 TMRM indicated that the mitochondrial matrix-induced
                 wavelength shift of TMRM also occurs in the heart
                 cytosol, eliminating the use of this approach in the

                 channels is mirrored by extensive biophysical
                 diversity. Subtype-selective antagonists have been used
                 to place different kinds of calcium channels in
                 functional categories. Dihydropyridine (DHP)
                 antagonists have been used, for example, to implicate
                 L-type calcium channels in the induction of NMDA
                 receptor-independent forms of synaptic plasticity.
                 DHPs, however, do not discriminate between the recently
                 identified Lp and Ls subtypes of L-type calcium
                 channel. The different properties of the two kinds of
                 L-type channels suggest that they may have different
                 functional roles. Ls channels are comparable with
                 cardiac L-type channels, whereas Lp channels show
                 low-threshold voltage-dependent potentiation. To
                 clarify the potential roles of Lp and Ls channels in
                 the induction of synaptic plasticity, we studied the
                 responses of these channels to trains of action
                 potentials. The frequency and duration of the trains
                 were chosen to mimic the stimuli used to induce changes
                 in synaptic strength. Cell-attached single-channel
                 recordings from cultured hippocampal neurons revealed
                 that both Lp and Ls channels responded to these trains,
                 but only Lp channels showed persistent activation that
                 outlasted the train. The magnitude of Lp channel
                 activity increased with increasing action potential
                 frequency and train duration. Stimuli that reproduced
                 the postsynaptic response to action potential trains
                 were also examined, and Lp channels were found to show
                 much greater responses than were Ls channels. These
                 results suggest that the Lp channel may play a critical
                 role in the induction of long-lasting changes in

                 steps in the central nervous system. It is generally
                 assumed that fast transmitter release is triggered by
                 elevations in intracellular calcium concentration
                 ([Ca2+]i) to at least 100 microM near the sites of
                 vesicle fusion. For synapses in the central nervous
                 system, however, there are no experimental estimates of
                 this local [Ca2+]i signal. Here we show, by using
                 calcium ion uncaging in the large synaptic terminals of
                 the calyx of Held, that step-like elevations to only 10
                 microM [Ca2+]i induce fast transmitter release, which
                 depletes around 80\% of a pool of available vesicles in
                 less than 3 ms. Kinetic analysis of transmitter release
                 rates after [Ca2+]i steps revealed the rate constants
                 for calcium binding and vesicle fusion. These show that
                 transient (around 0.5 ms) local elevations of [Ca2+]i
                 to peak values as low as 25 microM can account for
                 transmitter release during single presynaptic action
                 potentials. The calcium sensors for vesicle fusion are
                 far from saturation at normal release probability. This
                 non-saturation, and the high intracellular calcium
                 cooperativity in triggering vesicle fusion, make fast
                 synaptic transmission very sensitive to modulation by

                 and cations are equal (i.e., charge independent), so
                 that their different rates of transport across the
                 membrane are solely due to differential interactions
                 with the membrane phase. Here we investigate the
                 validity of this assumption by quantum mechanical
                 calculations of the hydration energies.
                 Tetraphenylborate (DeltaG(hydr) = -168 kJ mol(-1)) was
                 found to have a significantly stronger interaction with
                 water than either tetraphenylarsonium (DeltaG(hydr) =
                 -145 kJ mol(-1)) or tetraphenylphosphonium
                 (DeltaG(hydr) = -157 kJ mol(-1)). Taking these
                 differences into account, literature conductance data
                 were recalculated to yield values of the dipole
                 potential 57 to 119 mV more positive in the membrane
                 interior than previous estimates. This may partly
                 account for the discrepancy of at least 100 mV
                 generally observed between dipole potential values
                 calculated from lipid monolayers and those determined
                 on bilayers.",

  abstract =     "The M current, IM, a voltage-dependent
                 non-inactivating K current, was recorded in NG108-15
                 neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells, using the
                 whole-cell mode of the patch-clamp technique. We
                 studied inhibition of the M current by bradykinin,
                 phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu), an activator of protein
                 kinase C (PKC), and methylxanthines. Focal application
                 of 0.1-5 microM bradykinin inhibited IM by about 60\%;
                 5 nM bradykinin inhibited by about 40\%. Bath
                 application of 0.1 microM and 1 microM PDBu diminished
                 IM to about half of the control value. Staurosporine, a
                 PKC inhibitor, applied for 35-43 min in a concentration
                 of 0.3 microM significantly reduced the effect of 1
                 microM PDBu. M current blockage by PDBu could be partly
                 reversed by bath application of H-7 (51-64 microM),
                 another PKC inhibitor. These observations suggest that
                 the PDBu effect is really due to activation of PKC. The
                 findings are compatible with the view [Brown DA,
                 Higashida H (1988) J Physiol (Lond) 397:185-207] that
                 the bradykinin effect on IM is mediated by PKC.
                 However, three further observations suggest that this
                 is only true for part of the bradykinin effect. When
                 the suppression of IM by 1 microM PDBu was fully
                 developed, 0.1 microM bradykinin produced a further
                 inhibition of IM. Down-regulation of PKC by long-term
                 treatment with PDBu reduced the effect of 0.1 microM
                 bradykinin significantly but did not abolish it.
                 Staurosporine (0.3 microM, applied for 31-46 min)
                 failed to reduce the effect of 5 nM bradykinin
                 significantly. The M current could be reversibly
                 blocked by methylxanthines (caffeine,
                 isobutyl-methylxanthine, theophylline) in the
                 millimolar range, probably because of a direct action
                 on the M channels.",

                 realistically large number of ion channels is
                 investigated using a stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley (HH)
                 model. In sharp contrast to the deterministic HH model,
                 the biophysically inspired stochastic model reproduces
                 qualitatively the different reliability and precision
                 characteristics of spike firing in response to DC and
                 fluctuating current input in neocortical neurons, as
                 reported by Mainen & Sejnowski (1995). For DC inputs,
                 spike timing is highly unreliable; the reliability and
                 precision are significantly increased for fluctuating
                 current input. This behavior is critically determined
                 by the relatively small number of excitable channels
                 that are opened near threshold for spike firing rather
                 than by the total number of channels that exist in the
                 membrane patch. Channel fluctuations, together with the
                 inherent bistability in the HH equations, give rise to
                 three additional experimentally observed phenomena:
                 subthreshold oscillations in the membrane voltage for
                 DC input, spontaneous spikes for subthreshold inputs,
                 and missing spikes for suprathreshold inputs. We
                 suggest that the noise inherent in the operation of ion
                 channels enables neurons to act as smart encoders.
                 Slowly varying, uncorrelated inputs are coded with low
                 reliability and accuracy and, hence, the information
                 about such inputs is encoded almost exclusively by the
                 spike rate. On the other hand, correlated presynaptic
                 activity produces sharp fluctuations in the input to
                 the postsynaptic cell, which are then encoded with high
                 reliability and accuracy. In this case, information
                 about the input exists in the exact timing of the
                 spikes. We conclude that channel stochasticity should
                 be considered in realistic models of neurons.",

  abstract =     "It has been suggested that augmented nerve cell death
                 in neurodegenerative diseases might result from an
                 impairment of mitochondrial function. To test this
                 hypothesis, we investigated age-dependent changes in
                 neuronal survival and glutamate effects on Ca2+
                 homeostasis and mitochondrial energy metabolism in
                 cultured hippocampal neurons from diploid and trisomy
                 16 (Ts16) mice, a model of Down's syndrome.
                 Microfluorometric techniques were used to measure
                 survival rate, [Ca2+]i level, mitochondrial membrane
                 potential, and NAD(P)H autofluorescence. We found that
                 Ts16 neurons die more than twice as fast as diploid
                 neurons under otherwise identical culture conditions.
                 Basal [Ca2+]i levels were elevated in Ts16 neurons.
                 Moreover, in comparison to diploid neurons, Ts16
                 neurons showed a prolonged recovery of [Ca2+]i and
                 mitochondrial membrane potential after brief glutamate
                 application. Glutamate evoked an initial NAD(P)H
                 decrease that was found to be extended in Ts16 neurons
                 in comparison to diploid neurons. Furthermore, for all
                 age groups tested, glutamate failed to cause a
                 subsequent NAD(P)H overshoot in Ts16 cultures in
                 contrast to diploid cultures. In the presence of
                 cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial
                 membrane permeability transition, NAD(P)H increase was
                 observed in both diploid and Ts16 neurons. The results
                 support the hypothesis that Ca2+ impairs mitochondrial
                 energy metabolism and may play a role in the
                 pathogenesis of neurodegenerative changes in neurons
                 from Ts16 mice.",

                 (DPhPC) bilayer were investigated. Comparative voltage
                 clamp studies on plain and S-layer supported DPhPC
                 bilayers revealed no significant difference in the
                 capacitance. The conductance of the composite membrane
                 decreased slightly upon recrystallization of the
                 S-layer. Thus, the attached S-layer lattice did not
                 interpenetrate or rupture the DPhPC bilayer. The

                 could be detected upon adding alpha-hemolysin monomers

                 Therefore. the intrinsic molecular sieving properties
                 of the S-layer lattice do not allow passage of
                 alpha-hemolysin monomers through the S-layer pores to
                 the lipid bilayer. In comparison to plain lipid
                 bilayers, the S-layer supported lipid membrane had a

  abstract =     "Phospholipase D (PLD) generates lipid signals that
                 coordinate membrane trafficking with cellular
                 signaling. PLD activity in vitro and in vivo is
                 dependent on phosphoinositides with a vicinal
                 4,5-phosphate pair. Yeast and mammalian PLDs contain an
                 NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that has
                 been speculated to specify both subcellular
                 localization and regulation of PLD activity through
                 interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
                 (PI[4,5]P2). We report that mutation of the PH domains
                 of yeast and mammalian PLD enzymes generates
                 catalytically active PI(4,5)P2-regulated enzymes with
                 impaired biological functions. Disruption of the PH
                 domain of mammalian PLD2 results in relocalization of
                 the protein from the PI(4,5)P2-containing plasma
                 membrane to endosomes. As a result of this
                 mislocalization, mutations within the PH domain render
                 the protein unresponsive to activation in vivo.
                 Furthermore, the integrity of the PH domain is vital
                 for yeast PLD function in both meiosis and secretion.
                 Binding of PLD2 to model membranes is enhanced by
                 acidic phospholipids. Studies with PLD2-derived
                 peptides suggest that this binding involves a
                 previously identified polybasic motif that mediates
                 activation of the enzyme by PI(4,5)P2. By comparison,
                 the PLD2 PH domain binds PI(4,5)P2 with lower affinity
                 but sufficient selectivity to function in concert with
                 the polybasic motif to target the protein to
                 PI(4,5)P2-rich membranes. Phosphoinositides therefore
                 have a dual role in PLD regulation: membrane targeting
                 mediated by the PH domain and stimulation of catalysis
                 mediated by the polybasic motif.",

                 cyclosporin A-sensitive channel, can be opened by the
                 addition of protonophoric uncouplers such as carbonyl
                 cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) after
                 energy-dependent accumulation of Ca2+. We have proposed
                 that the relevant effect of FCCP on the pore is
                 membrane depolarization, suggesting that this channel
                 is voltage-dependent (Bernardi, P. (1992) J. Biol.
                 Chem. 267, 8334-8339). Here, we reconsider this
                 hypothesis in the light of recent observations
                 suggesting that increased production of reactive oxygen
                 species and/or direct effects of FCCP, rather than
                 membrane depolarization, could be the actual triggers
                 of the FCCP-dependent permeability transition. We show
                 that although reactive oxygen species can contribute to
                 the permeability transition, pore opening by FCCP can
                 still be observed under strict anaerobiosis after
                 ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation and that the
                 permeability transition can be induced by the addition
                 of valinomycin to respiring mitochondria treated with
                 nigericin in low potassium medium. In this system, pore
                 opening in increasing fractions of mitochondria depends
                 on the concentration of valinomycin, i.e. on the
                 magnitude of the potassium current that determines the
                 extent of membrane depolarization. We conclude that the
                 permeability transition pore is directly modulated by
                 the membrane potential in intact isolated rat liver
                 mitochondria.",

                 following hormone or growth factor stimulation in
                 epithelial cells. The software written in C runs on a
                 PC under Windows environment. It is based on a Markov
                 process where the dynamic of the system is
                 characterised by phenomenological transition
                 probabilities. Moreover a minimal model is proposed to
                 analyse the role of plasma channels and IP3 receptors,
                 together with the opposite action of the CaATPase
                 pumps, in the cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
                 calcium signal control. The simulation is applied on
                 the calcium response following stimulation by carbacol
                 (protein G coupled receptors) or epidermal growth
                 factor (tyrosine kinase type receptors) in A431
                 epithelial cells. The experimental calcium signals can
                 be grouped in three classes; a spike and a return to
                 the basal level (signal A), a spike and a decrease to a
                 plateau level (signal B) or a slow increase to a
                 plateau (signal C). Epidermal growth factor induces
                 signal A and B while carbacol gives signal B and C.
                 When a 'pseudo' steady state is reached oscillations
                 occur. Computer simulations show that signal A can
                 result from the activation of IP3 receptors while
                 signal C would result from the activation of the plasma
                 channels; signal B appears as the additive contribution
                 of both channels, while oscillations are compatible
                 with a calcium induced calcium release mechanism.
                 Simulations suggest that the calcium dynamic in the ER
                 is a mirror of cytosolic calcium but that a simple way
                 to produce similar calcium elevation in these two
                 compartments is to activate plasma channels.
                 Implications of such a mechanism is discussed.",

                 glioma hybrid cells transformed to express m1
                 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors using cell-attached
                 patch-electrodes. Channels showed multiple
                 conductances, with peaks at 6-9 and 12-15 pS. Averaged
                 currents showed time-dependent activation during 1 s
                 depolarization steps to around -30 mV. Steady-state Po
                 increased in a voltage-dependent manner when the
                 membrane was depolarized between 10 and 60 mV, with a
                 limiting slope of 5.5 mV/e-fold change in Po.
                 Steady-state kinetics were fit by two open and three
                 shut times: depolarization shortened shut times and
                 lengthened open times. Application of muscarine (10
                 microM) or bradykinin (10 microM) to the membrane
                 outside the patch reversibly reduced steady-state
                 in-patch channel activity to 38.4 +/- 11.7 and 28.8 +/-
                 6.1\% of control values, respectively. Inhibition was
                 accompanied by a lengthening of channel shut times
                 without significant change in open times or
                 distribution of conductance levels. No effect of
                 muscarine or bradykinin on whole-cell or membrane patch
                 delayed rectifier currents was detected. It is
                 concluded that M-channels in NG108-15 cells are
                 qualitatively similar to, but sparser than, those
                 previously reported in rat sympathetic neurones. Their
                 inhibition by extra-patch acetylcholine and bradykinin

  abstract =     "Recent evidence underlines a key role of mitochondrial
                 Ca2+ fluxes in cell Ca2+ signalling. We present here a
                 kinetic model simulating the Ca2+ fluxes generated by
                 mitochondria during mitochondrial Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+
                 release (mCICR) resulting from the operation of the
                 permeability transition pore (PTP). Our model connects
                 the Ca2+ fluxes through the ruthenium redsensitive Ca2+
                 uniporter, the respiration-dependent and passive H+
                 fluxes, the rate of oxygen consumption, the movements
                 of weak acids across the mitochondrial membrane, the
                 electrical transmembrane potential (delta psi), and
                 operation of the PTP. We find that two factors are
                 crucial to account for the various mCICR profiles that
                 can be observed experimentally: (i) the dependence of
                 PTP opening and closure on matrix pH (pHi), and (ii)
                 the relative inhibition of the respiratory rate
                 consecutive to PTP opening. The resulting model can
                 simulate irreversible Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria, as
                 well as the genesis of damped or sustained Ca2+
                 oscillations, and of single Ca2+ spikes. The model also
                 simulates the main features of mCICR, i.e. the
                 threshold-dependence of mCICR triggering, and the
                 all-or-nothing nature of mCICR operation. Our model
                 should appear useful to further mathematically address
                 the consequences of mCICR on the spatiotemporal
                 organisation of Ca2+ signals, as a 'plug-in' module for
                 the existing models of cell Ca2+ signalling.",

                 overlapping populations of neurons in widespread areas
                 of the brain, but labeling is distinct in a number of
                 areas. For example, IP3R is enriched in cerebellar
                 Purkinje cells and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells,
                 while RyR is present at relatively low levels in these
                 cells. RyR is most enriched in the dentate gyrus and
                 CA3/4 areas of the hippocampus, where IP3R levels are
                 low. In the cortex, IP3R is found in pyramidal cell
                 bodies and proximal dendrites, whereas RyR is located
                 predominantly in long, thin apical dendrites of
                 pyramidal cells. In deep cerebellar nuclei, RyR is
                 located in cell bodies that appear devoid of IP3R,
                 whereas IP3R is enriched in terminals surrounding cell
                 bodies. Electron microscopy in the hippocampus reveals
                 RyR in axons, dendritic spines, and dendritic shafts
                 near dendritic spines while IP3R is primarily
                 identified in dendritic shafts and cell bodies. These
                 results suggest that the IP3- and ryanodine-sensitive
                 Ca2+ pools have largely distinct roles in controlling
                 intracellular Ca2+ levels, though in some sites they
                 may interact to varying degrees.",

                 ([Ca]SR) in isolated rat cardiac microsomes,
                 ventricular tissue was homogenized in the presence of
                 the low-affinity Ca indicator furaptra. Stepwise
                 increases in cuvette [Ca] ([Ca]c) in the presence of
                 ATP caused progressive increases in steady-state
                 intravesicular fluorescence ratio to a maximum (Rmax).
                 Steady-state [Ca]SR/[Ca]c was approximately 7000.
                 Therefore the resting [Ca]SR may approach 700 microM in
                 the rat cardiac myocyte at [Ca]c = 100 nM. The
                 sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca pump requires a free

                 release kinetics in astrocytes may correspond to sites
                 of high inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R)
                 density. To examine this possibility, we compared the
                 distribution pattern of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
                 InsP3Rs with Ca2+ release kinetics in subcellular
                 regions during propagation of norepinephrine-evoked
                 waves. 3,3'-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide staining
                 revealed that the ER in astrocytes exists as a meshwork
                 of membranes extending throughout the cells, including
                 fine processes. A specific antibody directed against
                 type 2 InsP3Rs (InsP3R2) detected a 260-kDa band in
                 western blotting of astrocyte membranes.
                 Immunocytochemistry using this antibody stained the
                 entire ER system in a punctate, variegated manner. When
                 Ca2+ responses and InsP3R2 immunofluorescence were
                 compared in the same cell, domains of elevated Ca2+
                 response kinetics (high amplitude and rapid rate of
                 rise) showed significant positive correlation with high
                 local intensity of InsP3R2 staining. It appears,
                 therefore, that specializations in the ER responsible
                 for discrete local Ca2+ release sites that support
                 regenerative wave propagation include increased levels
                 of InsP3R2 expression.",

                 identified with the open-to-inactivated state kinetic

                 outermost arginine amino acid residues in segment 4
                 domain IV (R1, R2, R3) in gating charge inhibited by

                 from human heart Na channels with mutations of the
                 outermost arginines (R1C, R1Q, R2C, and R3C) expressed
                 in fused, mammalian tsA201 cells. All four mutations
                 had ionic currents that activated over the same voltage
                 range with slope factors of their peak
                 conductance-voltage (G-V) relationships similar to
                 those of wild-type channels, although decay of I(Na)
                 was slowest for R1C and R1Q mutant channels and fastest
                 for R3C mutant channels. After Na channel modification
                 by Ap-A toxin, decays of I(Na) were slowed to similar
                 values for all four channel mutants. Toxin modification
                 produced a graded effect on gating charge (Q) of mutant
                 channels, reducing Q(max) by 12\% for the R1C and R1Q
                 mutants, by 22\% for the R2C mutant, and by 27\% for
                 the R3C mutant, only slightly less than the 31\%
                 reduction seen for wild-type currents. Consistent with
                 these findings, the relationship of Q(max) to G(max)
                 was significantly shallower for R1 mutants than for R2C

                 mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi) precedes
                 apoptosis and chemical-hypoxia-induced necrosis and is
                 prevented by Bcl-2. In this report, we examine the
                 biochemical mechanism used by Bcl-2 to prevent Deltapsi
                 loss, as determined with mitochondria isolated from a
                 cell line overexpressing human Bcl-2 or from livers of
                 Bcl-2 transgenic mice. Although Bcl-2 had no effect on
                 the respiration rate of isolated mitochondria, it
                 prevented both Deltapsi loss and the permeability
                 transition (PT) induced by various reagents, including
                 Ca2+, H2O2, and tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Even under
                 conditions that did not allow PT, Bcl-2 maintained
                 Deltapsi, suggesting that the functional target of
                 Bcl-2 is regulation of Deltapsi but not PT. Bcl-2 also
                 maintained Deltapsi in the presence of the protonophore
                 SF6847, which induces proton influx, suggesting that
                 Bcl-2 regulates ion transport to maintain Deltapsi.
                 Although treatment with SF6847 in the absence of Ca2+
                 caused massive H+ influx in control mitochondria, the
                 presence of Bcl-2 induced H+ efflux after transient H+
                 influx. In this case, Bcl-2 did not enhance K+ efflux.
                 Furthermore, Bcl-2 enhanced H+ efflux but not K+ flux
                 after treatment of mitochondria with Ca2+ or tert-butyl
                 hydroperoxide. These results suggest that Bcl-2

                 Ins(1,4, 5)P(3) is used similarly by many receptors. In
                 single HEK-293 cells, ATP and carbamylcholine (CCh)

                 versatile than hitherto supposed, because the spatial

                 allows Ins(1,4, 5)P(3) made in response to each agonist

                 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors or ryanodine

                 clusters with several or tens of channels. The random

                 stochasticity into the elementary calcium release

                 experimentally observed in a variety of cell types and
                 have been termed sparks and puffs. We put forward a
                 stochastic version of the Li-Rinzel model (the

                 phospholipids occur by means of poorly characterized
                 intermediates. Many have proposed that membrane fusion
                 can also occur by formation of these intermediates.
                 Structures for such intermediates were proposed in a
                 recent theory of these transition mechanisms. Using
                 time-resolved cryotransmission electron microscopy
                 (TRC-TEM), we have directly visualized the evolution of
                 inverted phase microstructure in liposomal aggregates.
                 We have identified one of the proposed intermediates,
                 termed an interlamellar attachment (ILA), which has the
                 structure and dimensions predicted by the theory. We
                 show that ILAs are likely to be the structure
                 corresponding to lipidic particles observed by
                 freeze-fracture electron microscopy. ILAs appear to
                 assemble the inverted cubic (III) phase by formation of
                 an ILA lattice, as previously proposed. ILAs are also
                 observed to mediate membrane fusion in the same
                 systems, on the same time scale, and under nearly the
                 same conditions in which membrane fusion was observed
                 by fluorescence methods in earlier studies. These
                 earlier studies indicated a linkage between a membrane
                 fusion mechanism and III phase formation. Our
                 micrographs suggest that the same intermediate
                 structure mediates both of those processes; ; ;,",

                 isotropic 31P NMR resonances in multilamellar

                 cortical type-1 astrocytes, type-2 astrocytes and
                 oligodendrocytes. Perfusion with 10 microM
                 cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) or 1 microM thapsigargin
                 evoked a large and persistent elevation in cytosolic
                 [Ca2+] in normal Ca2+-containing medium and a small and
                 transient increase in nominally Ca2+-free medium.
                 Subtraction of the response in Ca2+-free medium from
                 that in the control revealed a slow-onset Ca2+-entry
                 response to SERCA inhibition, which began after most of
                 the store depletion had occurred. Thapsigargin- and
                 CPA-induced responses propagated as Ca2+ waves, which
                 began in several distinct cellular sites and travelled
                 throughout the cell and through nearby cells, in
                 confluent cultures. Propagation was supported by
                 specialized Ca2+-release sites where the amplitude of
                 the response was significantly higher and the rate of
                 rise steeper. Such higher Ca2+-release kinetics were
                 observed at these sites during Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated
                 Ca2+ waves in the same cells. Fluorescently tagged
                 thapsigargin labelled SERCA pumps throughout glial cell
                 bodies and processes. In oligodendrocyte processes,
                 multiple domains with elevated SERCA staining were
                 always associated with mitochondria. Our results are
                 consistent with a model in which only a single Ca2+
                 store, expressing Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors and SERCAs
                 sensitive to both thapsigargin and CPA, is present in
                 rat cortical glia, and indicate that inhibition of
                 SERCA activates both Ca2+ release as a wavefront and
                 Ca2+ entry via store-operated channels. The spatial
                 relationship between SERCAs and mitochondria is likely
                 to be important for regulating microdomains of elevated
                 Ca2+-release kinetics.",

                 amplitude and rate of rise of local Ca2+ signals are
                 markedly higher than in surrounding areas (Simpson, P.

                 33493-33501). In the present study we have examined the
                 effects of other phosphoinositide-coupled agonists on
                 Ca2+ in these cells, and the structural specializations
                 underlying regenerative wave amplification sites. Both
                 bradykinin and norepinephrine evoke Ca2+ waves, which
                 initiate at the same loci and propagate through the
                 cell body and multiple processes via identical wave
                 amplification sites. Antibodies against type 2 inositol
                 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R2) and
                 calreticulin identify expression of these proteins in

                 Immunocytochemistry followed by high resolution
                 fluorescence microscopy revealed that both InsP3R2 and
                 calreticulin are expressed in high intensity patches
                 along processes. Cross-correlation analysis of the

                 wave and immunofluorescence for these proteins along

                 endoplasmic reticulum protein expression correspond
                 closely to wave amplification sites. Staining cells
                 with the mitochondrial dye, MitoTracker(R), showed that

                 Ca2+ uptake from and release into the cytosol has
                 important consequences for neuronal and glial activity.
                 Ca2+ regulates mitochondrial metabolism, and
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release modulate
                 physiological and pathophysiological cytosolic
                 responses. In glial cells, inositol
                 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Ca2+ responses are
                 faithfully translated into elevations in mitochondrial
                 Ca2+ levels, which modifies cytosolic Ca2+ wave
                 propagation and may activate mitochondrial enzymes. The
                 location of mitochondria within neurones may partially
                 determine their role in Ca2+ signalling. Neuronal death
                 due to NMDA-evoked Ca2+ entry can be delayed by an
                 inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition
                 pore, and mitochondrial dysfunction is being
                 increasingly implicated in a number of
                 neurodegenerative conditions. These findings are
                 illustrative of an emerging realization by
                 neuroscientists of the importance of mitochondrial Ca2+
                 regulation as a modulator of cellular energetics,

                 oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (O-2A cells),
                 including proliferation, migration and differentiation,
                 are regulated by cytosolic Ca2+ signals. However,
                 little is known concerning the mechanisms of Ca2+
                 signalling in this cell type. We have studied the
                 interactions between Ca2+ entry, Ca2+ release from
                 endoplasmic reticulum and Ca2+ regulation by
                 mitochondria in influencing cytosolic Ca2+ responses in
                 O-2A cells. 2. Methacholine (MCh; 100 microM) activated
                 Ca2+ waves that propagated from several initiation
                 sites along O-2A processes. 3. During a Ca2+ wave
                 evoked by MCh, mitochondrial membrane potential was
                 often either depolarized (21 \% of mitochondria) or
                 hyperpolarized (20 \% of mitochondria), as measured by
                 changes in the fluorescence of
                 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,
                 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazole carbocyanine iodide (JC-1).
                 4. Stimulation with kainate (100 microM) evoked a
                 slowly rising, sustained cytosolic Ca2+ elevation in
                 O-2A cells. This also, in some cases, resulted in
                 either a depolarization (15 \% of mitochondria) or
                 hyperpolarization (12 \% of mitochondria) of
                 mitochondrial membrane potential. 5. Simultaneous
                 measurement of cytosolic (fluo-3 AM) and mitochondrial
                 (rhod-2 AM) Ca2+ responses revealed that Ca2+
                 elevations in the cytosol evoked by either MCh or
                 kainate were translated into long-lasting Ca2+
                 elevations in subpopulations of mitochondria. In some
                 mitochondria, Ca2+ signals appeared to activate Ca2+
                 release into the cytosol. 6. Inhibition of the
                 mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger by CGP-37157 (25
                 microM) decreased kainate Ca2+ response amplitude and
                 increased the rate of return of the response to basal
                 Ca2+ levels. 7. Thus, both ionotropic and metabotropic
                 stimulation evoke changes in mitochondrial membrane
                 potential and Ca2+ levels in O-2A cells. Ca2+ uptake
                 into some mitochondria is activated by Ca2+ entry into
                 cells or release from stores. Mitochondrial Ca2+
                 release appears to play a key role in shaping
                 kainate-evoked Ca2+ responses.",

                 and role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins
                 calreticulin and ryanodine receptors, and mitochondria,
                 in cultured astrocytes. Using several lines of
                 investigation, we have identified a key role for
                 mitochondria in astrocyte Ca2+ signalling: (1) a
                 significant correlation was found between sites of
                 regenerative Ca2+ wave amplification (possessing high
                 amplitude ER Ca2+ release) and the location of
                 mitochondria in the cell; (2) norepinephrine (2 microM)
                 caused a rapid-onset increase in rhod 2 fluorescence in
                 34\% of astrocyte mitochondria, indicating that
                 cytosolic Ca2+ responses result in mitochondrial Ca2+
                 elevation; and (3) pretreatment with the protonophore
                 carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone to
                 inhibit mitochondrial activity markedly reduced the
                 amplitude of subsequent norepinephrine-evoked cytosolic
                 Ca2+ responses. We then investigated the roles of
                 several ER proteins in Ca2+ signalling by
                 immunocytochemistry. Ryanodine receptors and
                 calreticulin were found to be expressed in
                 heterogeneous patterns in astrocytes. The expression
                 pattern of calreticulin corresponded closely with the
                 distribution of mitochondria, whereas the expression of
                 ryanodine receptors was not similar to that of either
                 of these cellular factors. We measured Ca2+ wave
                 kinetics in a single astrocyte, then assessed protein
                 distribution by immunocytochemistry in the same cell.
                 Cross-correlation between norepinephrine-evoked Ca2+
                 wave amplitude and calreticulin distribution indicated
                 a close spatial relationship between this Ca2+-binding
                 protein and sites of regenerative wave amplification.
                 These results demonstrate that amplification sites for
                 Ca2+ waves in astrocytes are identifiable by
                 accumulations of calreticulin (and type 2 InsP3Rs), and
                 by the presence of mitochondria, which may regulate the
                 ER Ca2+ release process.",

                 Ca2+-binding sites (residues 304-450 of mouse IP3R-1)

                 effect of Ca2+ on IP3 binding to IP3R-1. Calmodulin
                 also dose-dependently inhibited IP3 binding to Lbs-1
                 with an IC50 of about 3 microM. Maximal inhibition (10
                 microM calmodulin, 43.1 +/-5.9\%) was similar as
                 observed for Sf9-IP3R-1 microsomes (35.8 +/- 8.7\%).
                 Inhibition by calmodulin occurred independently of Ca2+
                 and was additive to the inhibitory effect of 5 microM
                 Ca2+ (together 74.5 +/- 5.1\%). These results suggest
                 that the N-terminal ligand-binding region of IP3R-1
                 contains a calmodulin-binding domain that binds
                 calmodulin independently of Ca2+ and that mediates the
                 inhibition of IP3 binding to IP3R-1.",

                 of their studies on the involvement of mitochondria in
                 apoptosis [Petit et al. (1996) FEBS Lett. 396, 7-13].
                 The mechanism consists in the release to the cytosol of
                 a protein (presumably a protease) that is normally
                 sequestered in the intermembrane space of mitochondria.
                 This protein, when added to isolated nuclei, caused
                 typical apoptotic changes. Its release from
                 mitochondria was shown to occur as a result of
                 disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane due to
                 swelling of mitochondria caused by opening of so-called
                 permeability transition pores in their inner membranes.
                 Increase in the level of products of the one-electron
                 reduction of O2 (reactive oxygen species, ROS) is known
                 to induce the mitochondrial pores. The hypothesis
                 described here assumes that pore formation and
                 apoptosis are involved in the organization of a defense
                 system preventing ROS formation. It is proposed that
                 ROS-induced pore opening lowers ROS production due to
                 (a) maximal stimulation of mitochondrial O2 consumption
                 and, hence, intracellular [O2] lowering and (b)
                 complete dissipation of mitochondrial membrane
                 potentials and, as a consequence, maximal oxidation of
                 such respiratory chain carriers as CoQ.- which serve as
                 one-electron O2 reductants. ROS decrease allows pore
                 closure. If, nevertheless, ROS are still accumulating
                 in a mitochondrion, long-lived pores cause degradation
                 of the organelle which cannot import and synthesize
                 proteins due to the absence of the membrane potential.
                 In this way, ROS-producing mitochondria can be
                 eliminated (mitochondrial selection). Another result of
                 the long-lived pores is mitochondrial swelling. This
                 disrupts the outer mitochondrial membrane and releases
                 the apoptosis-inducing protein. Apoptosis eliminates
                 ROS-producing cells (cell selection).",

                 with the assumption of two mechanisms of Ca2+ entry: a
                 channel-like flux and a carrier-mediated transport. At
                 low luminal [Ca2+] (1-5 mM), facilitated entry
                 dominates and saturates with Km = 0.4 mM. At luminal
                 [Ca2+] of tens of millimolar, apical permeability is
                 dominated by the channel flux that in turn is regulated
                 by cytosolic Ca2+. The model reproduces the linear
                 relationship between maximum Ca2+ transport rate and
                 intestinal calbindin D9K (CaBP) content. At luminal

                 facilitate the explorations of the spatial and temporal
                 patterns underlying higher cognitive functions in the
                 neocortex of behaving monkeys. Using this system, we
                 were able to explore cortical dynamics, with high
                 spatial and temporal resolution, over period of </=1 yr
                 from the same patch of cortex. The visual cortices of
                 trained macaques were stained one to three times a
                 week, and immediately after each staining session, the
                 monkey started to perform the behavioral task, while
                 the primary and secondary visual areas (V1 and V2) were
                 imaged with a fast optical imaging system. Long-term
                 repeated VSD imaging (VSDI) from the same cortical area
                 did not disrupt the normal cortical architecture as
                 confirmed repeatedly by optical imaging based on
                 intrinsic signals. The spatial patterns of functional
                 maps obtained by VSDI were essentially identical to
                 those obtained from the same patch of cortex by imaging
                 based on intrinsic signals. On comparing the relative
                 amplitudes of the evoked signals and differential map
                 obtained using these two different imaging
                 methodologies, we found that VSDI emphasizes
                 subthreshold activity more than imaging based on
                 intrinsic signals, that emphasized more spiking
                 activity. The latency of the VSD-evoked response in V1
                 ranged from 46 to 68 ms in the different monkeys. The
                 amplitude of the V2 response was only 20-60\% of that
                 in V1. As expected from the anatomy, the retinotopic
                 responses to local visual stimuli spread laterally
                 across the cortical surface at a spreading velocity of
                 0.15-0.19 m/s over a larger area than that expected by
                 the classical magnification factor, reaching its
                 maximal anisotropic spatial extent within ~40 ms. We
                 correlated the observed dynamics of cortical activation
                 patterns with the monkey's saccadic eye movements and
                 found that due to the slow offset of the cortical
                 response relative to its onset, there was a short
                 period of simultaneous activation of two distinct
                 patches of cortex following a saccade to the visual
                 stimulus. We also found that a saccade to a small
                 stimulus was followed by direct transient activation of
                 a cortical region in areas of V1 and V2, located
                 retinotopically within the saccadic trajectory.",

                 the argon-buffer interface have been determined for 38
                 lipid species comprising 19 chemical classes. These
                 lipids all exhibited a finite range of liquid-expanded
                 surface pressure-area behavior. For most species, the
                 linearity of surface potential with reciprocal area was
                 excellent, but nonzero intercepts were obtained. This
                 suggests a lipid-induced reorganization of interfacial
                 water molecules which is area independent. The
                 linearity of the data permits calculation of the
                 surface dipole moment, mu perpendicular, for each
                 lipid. The values of mu perpendicular for a series of
                 oleoyl-containing acylglycerols, dioleoyl
                 phosphatidylcholine, and dioleoyl
                 phosphatidylethanolamine exhibit acylglycerol ester
                 group mu perpendicular's which are generally consistent
                 with known conformational properties of such lipids.
                 The values are 132 mD for the perpendicular oleoyl
                 glycerol-ester group and 252 mD for that in the
                 kinked-chain conformation. Comparison of mu
                 perpendicular's calculated using these values with
                 homologues confirms the approximate independence of mu
                 perpendicular from aliphatic chain length and permits
                 identification of exceptions with possible
                 conformational or orientational differences. Notably,
                 diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine shows a 45\% larger mu
                 perpendicular than predicted. Differences in mu
                 perpendicular among lipid classes allow estimation of
                 the electrical consequences of lipid metabolism and
                 exchange. Calculations show that reactions such as the
                 generation of 1,2-diacylglycerol from diacyl
                 glycerophosphocholine or diacyl glycerophosphoinositol
                 should produce surface potential changes of -127 and
                 +42 mV, respectively. Thus, the two phospholipids are

                 performed calculations using a simplified finite

                 governed by the force-free diffusion equation. The
                 finite element method was adopted because of its
                 flexibility in modeling irregular geometries and
                 complex boundary conditions. The resulting simulations

                 agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) signals in
                 oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OP cells). We
                 measured transmembrane potential across the
                 mitochondrial inner membrane (delta psi m) and [Ca2+]c
                 in the immediate vicinity simultaneously using
                 tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) and calcium
                 green respectively. Stimulation of OP cells with
                 methacholine evoked robust [Ca2+]c signals in
                 approximately 80\% of cells which were either
                 oscillatory or showed a peak followed by a plateau.
                 Elevations in [Ca2+]c induced by supramaximal
                 concentrations of the agonist (> 200 microM) were
                 accompanied by changes in delta psi m in 33-42\% of the
                 total mitochondria investigated. The mitochondria that
                 responded either depolarized (26-29\%), hyperpolarized
                 (7-13\%) or showed no change (58-67\%). Thus, of the
                 responsive mitochondria, most (70\%) depolarized during
                 agonist-evoked [Ca2+]c signals. Blockade of PTP with
                 cyclosporin A (CSA) reduced the number of mitochondria
                 that depolarized with a corresponding increase in the
                 number that hyperpolarized. In addition, CSA or its
                 analogue methyl valine-4- CSA (MeVal-CSA), reduced the
                 frequency of agonist-evoked global [Ca2+]c
                 oscillations. In resting cells, CSA (63\%) and
                 MeVal-CSA (77\%) hyperpolarized a majority of the
                 mitochondria suggesting that PTP is constitutively
                 active and may show flickering openings. Such
                 hyperpolarizations were not mimicked by either
                 cyclosporine H or verapamil and were inhibited by
                 Ru360, which blocks the mitochondrial uniporter. This
                 observation suggested that in resting cells, Ca2+ ions
                 might redistribute between cytosol and mitochondrial
                 matrix through the uniporter and the PTP. Taken
                 together, these data suggest that PTP may play an
                 important role in regulating delta psi m and local
                 [Ca2+]c signals during agonist stimulation in OP
                 cells.",

  abstract =     "The problem of the breakup of an atomic particle in a
                 constant homogeneous electric field is considered. An
                 asymptotically exact (in the limit of low field
                 intensity) expression is obtained for the probability
                 of the detatchment of an electron per unit time. The
                 result obtained is used to determine the binding energy
                 of an electron in a negative helium ion from the
                 experimentally measured dependence of the lifetime of
                 the ion on the intensity of the external electric field
                 in which it is breaking up. The electron affinity
                 energy of a helium atom is 0.06±0.005eV. The cross
                 section for the breaking up of a negative ion by
                 electron impact as a result of which an s-electron is
                 liberated has been calculated. For this it is assumed
                 that the break up cross section is large compared to
                 the characteristic dimension of a negative ion and that
                 the incident electron moves in a classical orbit. These
                 assumptions are justified by the result obtained. Two
                 mechanisms of breakup of negative ions are considered:
                 the squeezing out of a weakly bound electron of a
                 negative ion by the static field of the incident
                 electron and the breakup resulting from the time
                 variation of the field of the incident electron. It is
                 shown that at high collision velocities the second
                 mechanism gives a result corresponding to the Born
                 approximation. The dependence of the cross section for
                 the breakup of H- on the velocity of the incident
                 electron is compared to the results of other
                 calculations.",

                 Using this full (open cell) model, we simulate [Ca2+]i
                 responses for protocols in which antigen concentration
                 and external Ca2+ are manipulated and compare out
                 calculations with experimental data. In protocol A,
                 cells are stimulated in the presence of external Ca2+,
                 in protocols B and C, cells are stimulated in the
                 absence of external Ca2+, with external Ca2+ later
                 reapplied in protocol C. We are able to reproduce
                 quantitatively the important features of all three
                 protocols, including the dose response of protocol B,
                 the [Ca2+]i response to thapsigargin, and lag time
                 results, and we provide qualitative explanations for
                 the responses derived from our calculations. We also
                 develop a simplified (closed cell) version of the model
                 in which PM fluxes are neglected and total free Ca2+
                 concentration ([Ca2+]T) is a slowly varying parameter.
                 This permits us to explain in a simple graphical
                 fashion how PM fluxes may influence [Ca2+]i responses
                 in RBH-2H3 cells through modulation of [Ca2+]T.",

                 coupling in heart muscle are Ca2+ sparks, which arise
                 from one or more ryanodine receptors in the
                 sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Here a simple numerical
                 model is constructed to explore Ca2+ spark formation,
                 detection, and interpretation in cardiac myocytes. This
                 model includes Ca2+ release, cytosolic diffusion,
                 resequestration by SR Ca2+-ATPases, and the association
                 and dissociation of Ca2+ with endogenous Ca2+-binding
                 sites and a diffusible indicator dye (fluo-3).
                 Simulations in a homogeneous, isotropic cytosol
                 reproduce the brightness and the time course of a
                 typical cardiac Ca2+ spark, but underestimate its
                 spatial size ( approximately 1.1 &mgr;m vs.
                 approximately 2.0 &mgr;m). Back-calculating [Ca2+]i by
                 assuming equilibrium with indicator fails to provide a
                 good estimate of the free Ca2+ concentration even when
                 using blur-free fluorescence data. A parameter
                 sensitivity study reveals that the mobility, kinetics,
                 and concentration of the indicator are essential
                 determinants of the shape of Ca2+ sparks, whereas the
                 stationary buffers and pumps are less influential.
                 Using a geometrically more complex version of the

                 is better explained by anisotropic diffusion of Ca2+
                 ions and indicator dye rather than by subsarcomeric
                 inhomogeneities of the Ca2+ buffer and transport
                 system. In addition, we examine the contribution of

                 significantly to a range of human disorders, including
                 neurodegenerative diseases, ischaemia-reperfusion
                 injury and ageing-associated dysfunction. To prevent

                 active antioxidant moiety of vitamin E to mitochondria.
                 This was carried out by covalently coupling the
                 antioxidant moiety to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium
                 cation. This mitochondrially targeted antioxidant,
                 2-[2-(triphenylphosphonio)ethyl]-3,4-dihydro-2,
                 5,7,8-tetramethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-ol bromide (TPPB),
                 accumulated several-hundred fold within the
                 mitochondrial matrix, driven by the organelle's large
                 membrane potential. When cells were incubated with
                 micromolar concentrations of TPPB, they accumulated
                 millimolar concentrations within their mitochondria.
                 The amount of TPPB taken up by mitochondria was
                 approximately 80-fold greater than endogenous levels of
                 vitamin E. Consequently the targeted derivative of
                 vitamin E protected mitochondrial function from
                 oxidative damage far more effectively than vitamin E
                 itself. The mitochondrially targeted antioxidant TPPB
                 has potential as an antioxidant therapy for disorders
                 involving mitochondrial oxidative damage. It also

                 generation of Ca2+ oscillations and waves. However,

                 the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
                 (PIP2) is required for sperm-induced egg activation in
                 Xenopus laevis. Here we measure the endogenous
                 production of both Ins(1,4,5)P3 and PIP2 during the
                 sperm-induced and ionomycin-induced calcium wave in the
                 egg and find that both increase following
                 fertilization. Ins(1,4,5)P3 increases 3.2-fold from an
                 unfertilized egg level of 0.13 pmole per egg (0.29
                 microM) to a peak of 0.42 pmole per egg (0.93 microM)
                 as the calcium wave reaches the antipode in the
                 fertilized egg. This continuous production of
                 Ins(1,4,5)P3 during the time that the Ca2+ wave is
                 propagating across the egg suggests the involvement of
                 Ins(1,4,5)P3 in wave propagation. This increase in
                 Ins(1,4,5)P3 is smaller in ionomycin-activated eggs
                 than in sperm-activated eggs, suggesting that the
                 sperm-induced production of Ins(1,4,5)P3 involves a
                 PIP2 hydrolysis pathway that is not simply raising
                 intracellular Ca2+. While one might expect PIP2 levels
                 to fall as a result of hydrolysis, we find that PIP2
                 actually increases 2-fold. The total lipid fraction in
                 unfertilized egg exhibits 0.8 pmole PIP2 per egg and
                 this increases to 1.5 pmole as the calcium wave reaches
                 the antipode. The PIP2 concentration peaks 2 min after
                 the completion of the calcium wave at 1.8 pmole per
                 egg. The amount of PIP2 in the animal and vegetal
                 hemispheres of the egg was also measured by cutting
                 frozen eggs in half. The vegetal hemisphere contained
                 twice the amount of PIP2 as the animal hemisphere but
                 it also contained twice the amount of lipid. Thus,
                 there was an equivalent amount of PIP2 normalized to
                 lipid in each hemisphere. Isolated animal and vegetal
                 hemisphere cortices exhibit similar PIP2
                 concentrations, suggesting that the 2-fold higher total
                 PIP2 in the vegetal half is not due to a gradient of
                 PIP2 in the plasma membrane, but rather implies that
                 cytoplasmic organelle membranes also contain PIP2.",

                 from a set of simultaneously interacting Ca(2+)
                 regulatory mechanisms. In this study, cardiocyte Ca(2+)
                 dynamics were modeled using a set of six differential
                 equations that were based on theories, equations, and
                 parameters described in previous studies. Among the
                 unique features of the model was the inclusion of
                 bidirectional modulatory interplay between the
                 sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+) release channel (SRRC)
                 and calsequestrin (CSQ) in the SR lumen, where CSQ
                 acted as a dynamic rather than simple Ca(2+) buffer,
                 and acted as a Ca(2+) sensor in the SR lumen as well.
                 The inclusion of this control mechanism was central in
                 overcoming a number of assumptions that would otherwise
                 have to be made about SRRC kinetics, SR Ca(2+) release
                 rates, and SR Ca(2+) release termination when the SR
                 lumen is assumed to act as a simple, buffered Ca(2+)
                 sink. The model was sufficient to reproduce a graded
                 Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) response, CICR
                 with high gain, and a system with reasonable stability.

  abstract =     "A Ca2+ spark arises when a cluster of sarcoplasmic
                 reticulum (SR) channels (ryanodine receptors or RyRs)
                 opens to release calcium in a locally regenerative
                 manner. Normally triggered by Ca2+ influx across the
                 sarcolemmal or transverse tubule membrane neighboring
                 the cluster, the Ca2+ spark has been shown to be the
                 elementary Ca2+ signaling event of
                 excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle.
                 However, the question of how the Ca2+ spark terminates
                 remains a central, unresolved issue. Here we present a
                 new model, sticky cluster, of SR Ca2+ release that
                 simulates Ca2+ spark behavior and enables robust Ca2+
                 spark termination. Two newly documented features of RyR
                 behavior have been incorporated in this otherwise
                 simple model: coupled gating and an opening rate that
                 depends on SR lumenal [Ca2+]. Using a Monte Carlo
                 method, local Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from clusters
                 containing between 10 and 100 RyRs is modeled. After
                 release is triggered, Ca2+ flux from RyRs diffuses into
                 the cytosol and binds to intracellular buffers and the
                 fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 to produce the model
                 Ca2+ spark. Ca2+ sparks generated by the sticky cluster
                 model resemble those observed experimentally, and Ca2+
                 spark duration and amplitude are largely insensitive to
                 the number of RyRs in a cluster. As expected from heart
                 cell investigation, the spontaneous Ca2+ spark rate in
                 the model increases with elevated cytosolic or SR
                 lumenal [Ca2+]. Furthermore, reduction of RyR coupling
                 leads to prolonged model Ca2+ sparks just as treatment
                 with FK506 lengthens Ca2+ sparks in heart cells. This
                 new model of Ca2+ spark behavior provides a proof of
                 principle test of a new hypothesis for Ca2+ spark
                 termination and reproduces critical features of Ca2+
                 sparks observed experimentally.",

                 localized in the terminal cisternae (TC) in resting
                 frog muscle as determined by electron-probe analysis of
                 ultrathin cryosections. During a 1.2 s tetanus, 59\%
                 (69 mmol/kg dry TC) of the Ca content of the TC was
                 released, enough to raise total cytoplasmic Ca
                 concentration by .apprx. 1 mM. This is equivalent to
                 the concentration of binding sites on the Ca binding
                 proteins (troponin and parvalbumin) in frog muscle. Ca
                 release was associated with a significant uptake of Mg
                 and K into the TC, but the amount of Ca released
                 exceeded the total measured cation accumulation by 62
                 mEq/kg dry wt. Most of the charge deficit may be
                 apparent. Charge compensation apparently is achieved by
                 movement of protons into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
                 (SR) and/or by the movement of organic co- or
                 counterions not measured by energy dispersive
                 electron-probe analysis. There was no significant
                 change in the Na or Cl content of the TC during
                 tetanus. The unchanged distribution of permeant anion,
                 Chloride, argues against the existence of a large and
                 sustained trans SR potential during tetanus, if the
                 chloride permeability of the in situ SR is as high as
                 suggested by measurements on fractionated SR. The Ca
                 content of the longitudinal SR (LSR) during tetanus did
                 not show the LSR to be a major site of Ca storage and
                 delayed return to the TC. The K concentration in the
                 LSR did not differ significantly from the adjacent
                 cytoplasmic concentration. Analysis of small areas of
                 l-band and large areas, including several sarcomeres,
                 suggested that Chloride is anisotropically distributed,
                 with some of it probably bound to myosin. The
                 distribution of K in the fiber cytoplasm followed the
                 water distribution. The mitochondrial concentration of
                 Ca was low and did not change significantly during a
                 tetanus. The TC of both tetanized and resting
                 freeze-substituted muscles contained electron-lucent
                 circular areas. The appearance of the TC showed no
                 evidence of major volume changes during tetanus, in
                 agreement with the estimates of unchanged (.apprx.
                 72\%) water content of the TC obtained with

                 putative quenching groups near the S4 segment. One
                 group was detected by M356C-TMRM (located outside of S3
                 in the deletion mutant) and reported on deactivation
                 gating charge movement when applying hyperpolarizing
                 voltage steps from a holding potential of 0 mV. During
                 activating voltage steps from a holding potential of
                 -90 mV, the fluorescence lagged considerably behind the
                 movement of gating charge over a range of potentials.
                 Another putative quenching group was seen by probes
                 attached closer to the S4 and caused a DeltaF at
                 extreme hyperpolarizations (more negative than -90 mV)
                 only. A signal from the interaction with this group in
                 the wt S3-S4 linker channel (at L361C) correlated with
                 gating charge moving in the hyperpolarized part of the
                 Q-V curve. Probe attached at A359C in the deletion
                 mutant and at L361C in wt channel showed a biphasic
                 DeltaF as the probe oscillated between the two groups,
                 revealing that there is a transient state of the
                 voltage sensor in between, where the probe has maximal
                 fluorescence. We conclude that the voltage sensor
                 undergoes two distinct conformational changes as seen
                 from probes attached outside the S4 segment.",

                 analytical techniques have provided important new
                 insights into dendritic spine structure and function.
                 Results are accumulating across many disciplines, and a
                 step toward consolidating some of this work has
                 resulted in Dendritic Spines of the Hippocampus.
                 Leaders in the field provide a discussion at the level
                 of advanced under-graduates, with sufficient detail to
                 be a contemporary resource for research scientists.
                 Critical reviews are presented on topics ranging from
                 spine structure, formation, and maintenance, to
                 molecular composition, plasticity, and the role of
                 spines in learning and memory. Dendritic Spines of the
                 Hippocampus provides a timely discussion of our current
                 understanding of form and function at these excitatory
                 synapses. We asked authors to include areas of
                 controversy in their papers so as to distinguish
                 results that are generally agreed upon from those where
                 multiple interpretations are possible. We thank the

                 plasticity, and pathology of hippocampal dendritic
                 spines. In addition, we highlight where each of these

                 whether mitochondria are capable of sequestering enough
                 Ca2+ from cytosolic Ca2+ pulses to raise their
                 intramitochondrial free Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]m). This is
                 significant because an increase in [Ca2+]m has been
                 linked to an increase in cellular metabolic rate
                 through various mechanisms. To resolve this question,
                 we exposed isolated liver mitochondria to physiological
                 type pulses of Ca2+ produced using a pulse-generating
                 system (Sparagna, G. C., Gunter, K. K., and Gunter, T.
                 E. (1994) Anal. Biochem. 219, 96-103). We then measured
                 the resulting mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. The uniporter
                 was previously thought to be the only specific Ca2+
                 uptake mechanism in mitochondria. Our studies have
                 uncovered an additional uptake mechanism, the rapid
                 mode of uptake or RaM, which functions at the beginning
                 of each pulse and allows mitochondria to sequester a
                 considerable amount of Ca2+ from short pulses. We have
                 shown that the RaM is reset by decreasing the [Ca2+]
                 between pulses for a very short time, making this
                 uptake mode ideally suited for Ca2+ sequestration from
                 Ca2+ pulse sequences. With rapid Ca2+ uptake occurring
                 at the beginning of each pulse, liver mitochondria may
                 be able to sequester sufficient Ca2+ from a short
                 sequence of pulses to activate the cellular metabolic
                 rate.",

                 activated dendritic spines, where the smooth
                 endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is likely to be important
                 for regulating calcium. Here, the dimensions and
                 organization of the SER in hippocampal spines and
                 dendrites were measured through serial electron
                 microscopy and three-dimensional analysis. SER of some
                 form was found in 58\% of the immature spines and in
                 48\% of the adult spines. Less than 50\% of the small
                 spines at either age contained SER, suggesting that
                 other mechanisms, such as cytoplasmic buffers, regulate
                 ion fluxes within their small volumes. In contrast,
                 >80\% of the large mushroom spines of the adult had a
                 spine apparatus, an organelle containing stacks of SER
                 and dense-staining plates. Reconstructed SER occupied
                 0.001-0.022 mu m(3), which was only 2-3.5\% of the
                 total spine volume; however, the convoluted SER
                 membranes had surface areas of 0.12-2.19 mu m(2), which
                 were 12 to 40\% of the spine surface area. Coated
                 vesicles and multivesicular bodies occurred in some
                 spines, suggesting local endocytotic activity. Smooth
                 vesicles and tubules of SER were found in continuity
                 with the spine plasma membrane and margins of the
                 postsynaptic density (PSD), respectively, suggesting a
                 role for the SER in the addition and recycling of spine
                 membranes and synapses. The amount of SER in the parent
                 dendrites was proportional to the number of spines and
                 synapses originating along their lengths. These
                 measurements support the hypothesis that the SER
                 regulates the ionic and structural milieu of some, but
                 not all, hippocampal dendritic spines.",

                 (PtdIns(4,5)P2) is a well-characterized precursor for
                 the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate,
                 diacylglycerol [1] and phosphatidylinositol
                 3,4,5-trisphosphate [2], it also interacts with the
                 actin-binding proteins profilin and gelsolin [3], as
                 well as with many signaling molecules that contain
                 pleckstrin homology (PH) domains [4]. It is conceivable
                 that stimuli received by receptors in the plasma
                 membrane could be sufficiently strong to decrease the
                 PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentration; this decrease could alter
                 the structure of the cortical cytoskeleton and modulate
                 the activity of signaling molecules that have PH
                 domains. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using an in
                 vivo fluorescent indicator for PtdIns(4,5)P2, by
                 tagging the PH domain of phospholipase C delta 1
                 (PLC-delta 1) with the green fluorescent protein
                 (GFP-PH). When expressed in cells, GFP-PH was found to
                 be enriched at the plasma membrane. Binding studies in
                 vitro and mutant analysis suggested that GFP-PH bound
                 PtdIns(4,5)P2 selectively over other
                 phosphatidylinositol lipids. Strikingly, receptor
                 stimulation induced a transient dissociation of GFP-PH
                 from the plasma membrane, suggesting that the
                 concentration of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane
                 was effectively lowered. This transient dissociation
                 was blocked by the PLC inhibitor U73122 but was not
                 affected by the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase
                 inhibitor wortmannin, suggesting that it is mostly
                 mediated by PLC and not by PI 3-kinase activation.
                 Overall, our studies show that PtdIns(4,5)P2 can have
                 second messenger functions of its own, by mediating a
                 transient dissociation of proteins anchored in the

                 fluctuate randomly between different conformational
                 states due to thermal agitation. Fluctuations between
                 conducting and nonconducting states give rise to noisy
                 membrane currents and subthreshold voltage fluctuations
                 and may contribute to variability in spike timing. Here
                 we study subthreshold voltage fluctuations due to
                 active voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels as predicted
                 by two commonly used kinetic schemes: the Mainen et al.
                 (1995) (MJHS) kinetic scheme, which has been used to
                 model dendritic channels in cortical neurons, and the
                 classical Hodgkin-Huxley (1952) (HH) kinetic scheme for
                 the squid giant axon. We compute the magnitudes,
                 amplitude distributions, and power spectral densities
                 of the voltage noise in isopotential membrane patches
                 predicted by these kinetic schemes. For both schemes,
                 noise magnitudes increase rapidly with depolarization
                 from rest. Noise is larger for smaller patch areas but
                 is smaller for increased model temperatures. We
                 contrast the results from Monte Carlo simulations of
                 the stochastic nonlinear kinetic schemes with
                 analytical, closed-form expressions derived using
                 passive and quasi-active linear approximations to the
                 kinetic schemes. For all subthreshold voltage ranges,
                 the quasi-active linearized approximation is accurate
                 within 8\% and may thus be used in large-scale
                 simulations of realistic neuronal geometries.",

                 been unclear, however, whether DCC proteins are
                 involved directly in signaling or are mere accessory
                 proteins in a receptor complex. Further, although
                 netrins bind cells expressing DCC, direct binding to
                 DCC has not been demonstrated. Here we show that
                 netrin-1 binds DCC and that the DCC cytoplasmic domain
                 fused to a heterologous receptor ectodomain can mediate
                 guidance through a mechanism involving derepression of
                 cytoplasmic domain multimerization. Activation of the
                 adenosine A2B receptor, proposed to contribute to
                 netrin effects on axons, is not required for rat
                 commissural axon outgrowth or Xenopus spinal axon
                 attraction to netrin-1. Thus, DCC plays a central role

                 We obtained a 20-80\% rise time (tr) of approximately
                 80 micros at 22 degrees C, shorter than any previously

                 can increase tr and its variability by 2- to 3-fold.
                 Using Monte Carlo simulations, we modeled passive
                 acetylcholine diffusion through a vesicle fusion pore
                 expanding radially at 25 nm x ms(-1) (rapid, from

                 recordings. Voltage clamp methods were optimized for
                 the fast MEPC rising phase using custom electronics.
                 From 0-43 degrees C, A(c) increased by approximately
                 4.2-fold, while t(r) and t(f) decreased by
                 approximately 3.6- and approximately 9.5-fold,
                 respectively. Arrhenius plots were smoothly curved,
                 with small apparent Q(10) (A(c)) or (Q(10))(-1) (t(r)
                 and t(f)) values mostly well below 2.0. Nearly
                 identical extracellular and voltage clamp results ruled
                 out measurement artifacts, even for the shortest t(r)
                 values (<60 microseconds). Monte Carlo simulation of
                 MEPCs showed that a single underlying rate cannot
                 determine the observed temperature dependence. To
                 quantitatively reproduce the experimental t(f) results,
                 a minimal model required activation energies of 46.0

                 characterized by second harmonic generation in the
                 presence of intense laser beams. We present a new
                 technique involving polarization modulation of an
                 ultra-short pulse laser beam that can simultaneously
                 determine collagen fiber orientation and a parameter
                 related to the second-order nonlinear susceptibility.
                 We demonstrate the ability to discriminate among
                 different patterns of fibrillar orientation, as
                 exemplified by tendon, fascia, cornea, and successive
                 lamellar rings in an intervertebral disc. Fiber
                 orientation can be measured as a function of depth with
                 an axial resolution of approximately 10 microm. The
                 parameter related to the second-order nonlinear
                 susceptibility is sensitive to fiber disorganization,
                 oblique incidence of the beam on the sample, and
                 birefringence of the tissue. This parameter represents

                 backscattered second harmonic signal generated by a 100
                 fs laser in rat-tail tendon collagen. Damage to the
                 sample is avoided by using a continuous scanning
                 technique, rather than measuring the signal at discrete
                 points. The second harmonic signal varies by about a
                 factor of 2 across a single cross section of the
                 rat-tail tendon fascicle. The signal intensity depends
                 both on the collagen organization and the
                 backscattering efficiency. This implies that we cannot
                 use intensity measurements alone to characterize
                 collagen structure. However, we can infer structural
                 information from the polarization dependence of the
                 second harmonic signal. Axial and transverse scans for
                 different linear polarization angles of the input beam
                 show that second harmonic generation (SHG) in the
                 rat-tail tendon depends strongly on the polarization of

                 for the SHG as a function of the polarization angle in
                 the rat-tail tendon. We apply this model in determining
                 the orientation of collagen fibrils in the fascicle and
                 the ratio gamma between the two independent elements of
                 the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor. There

                 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3))-dependent cytosolic
                 calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) increases resulting from agonist
                 stimulation are initiated in an apical trigger zone,
                 where the vast majority of InsP(3) receptors (InsP(3)R)
                 are localized. At threshold stimulation, [Ca(2+)](i)
                 signals are confined to this region, whereas at
                 concentrations of agonists that optimally evoke
                 secretion, a global Ca(2+) wave results. Simple
                 diffusion of Ca(2+) from the trigger zone is unlikely
                 to account for a global [Ca(2+)](i) elevation.
                 Furthermore, mitochondrial import has been reported to
                 limit Ca(2+) diffusion from the trigger zone. As such,
                 there is no consensus as to how local [Ca(2+)](i)
                 signals become global responses. This study therefore
                 investigated the mechanism responsible for these
                 events. Agonist-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations were
                 converted to sustained [Ca(2+)](i) increases after
                 inhibition of mitochondrial Ca(2+) import. These
                 [Ca(2+)](i) increases were dependent on Ca(2+) release
                 from the endoplasmic reticulum and were blocked by 100
                 microM ryanodine. Similarly, uncaging of physiological
                 [Ca(2+)](i) levels in whole-cell patch-clamped cells
                 resulted in rapid activation of a Ca(2+)-activated
                 current, the recovery of which was prolonged by
                 inhibition of mitochondrial import. This effect was
                 also abolished by ryanodine receptor (RyR) blockade.
                 Photolysis of d-myo InsP(3)
                 P(4(5))-1-(2-nitrophenyl)-ethyl ester (caged InsP(3))
                 produced either apically localized or global
                 [Ca(2+)](i) increases in a dose-dependent manner, as
                 visualized by digital imaging. Mitochondrial inhibition
                 permitted apically localized increases to propagate
                 throughout the cell as a wave, but this propagation was
                 inhibited by ryanodine and was not seen for minimal
                 control responses resembling [Ca(2+)](i) puffs. Global
                 [Ca(2+)](i) rises initiated by InsP(3) were also
                 reduced by ryanodine, limiting the increase to a region
                 slightly larger than the trigger zone. These data
                 suggest that, while Ca(2+) release is initially
                 triggered through InsP(3)R, release by RyRs is the
                 dominant mechanism for propagating global waves. In
                 addition, mitochondrial Ca(2+) import controls the
                 spread of Ca(2+) throughout acinar cells by modulating
                 RyR activation.",

                 propagate within neurons is therefore fundamental to an
                 understanding of neuronal function. While work from the
                 1950s suggested that action potentials are initiated in

                 potential initiation is in the axon, even when synaptic
                 activation is powerful enough to elicit dendritic
                 electrogenesis. Furthermore, these and other studies
                 also show that following initiation, action potentials
                 actively backpropagate into the dendrites of many
                 neuronal types, providing a retrograde signal of

                 concentrations. Free axoplasmic [K+] ranged from
                 approximately 155 mM in large PNS and CNS axons to
                 approximately 120-130 mM in smaller fibers. Free [Na+]
                 was approximately 15-17 mM in larger fibers compared

                 found to be 30-55 mM in all axons. Because
                 intracellular Ca is largely bound, ionized
                 concentrations were not estimated. However,
                 calculations of total (free plus bound) aqueous
                 concentrations of this element showed that axoplasm of
                 large CNS and PNS axons contained approximately 0.7 mM
                 Ca, whereas small fibers contained 0.1-0.2 mM.
                 Calculated ionic equilibrium potentials were as follows

                 = 60, and E(Cl) = -28; in Schwann cells, E(K) = -107,
                 E(Na) = 33, and E(Cl) = -33; and in CNS glia, E(K) =
                 -99, E(Na) = 36, and E(Cl) = -44. Calculated resting
                 membrane potentials were as follows (in mV, including
                 the contribution of the Na+,K+-ATPase): large axons,
                 about -80; small axons, about -72 to -78; and CNS glia,

  abstract =     "1. We have developed a mathematical model of the
                 L-type Ca2+ current, which is based on data from
                 whole-cell voltage clamp experiments on rat ventricular
                 myocytes. Ion substitution methods were employed to
                 investigate the ionic selectivity of the channel.
                 Experiments were configured with Na+, Ca2+ or Ba2+ as
                 the majority current carrier. 2. The amplitude of
                 current through the channel is attenuated in the
                 presence of extracellular Ca2+ or Ba2+. Our model
                 accounts for channel selectivity by using a modified
                 Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) configuration that employs
                 voltage-dependent channel binding functions for
                 external divalent ions. Stronger binding functions were
                 used for Ca2+ than for Ba2+. 3. Decay of the ionic
                 current during maintained depolarization was
                 characterized by means of voltage- and Ca2+-dependent
                 inactivation pathways embedded in a five-state dynamic
                 channel model. Particularly, Ca2+ first binds to
                 calmodulin and the Ca2+-calmodulin complex is the
                 mediator of Ca2+ inactivation. Ba2+-dependent
                 inactivation was characterized using the ttau same
                 scheme, but with a decreased binding to calmodulin. 4.
                 A reduced amount of steady-state inactivation, as
                 evidenced by a U-shaped curve at higher depolarization
                 levels (>40 mV) in the presence of [Ca2+]o, was
                 observed in double-pulse protocols used to study
                 channel inactivation. To characterize this phenomenon,
                 a mechanism was incorporated into the model whereby
                 Ca2+ or Ba2+ also inhibits the voltage-dependent
                 inactivation pathway. 5. The five-state dynamic channel
                 model was also used to simulate single channel
                 activity. Calculations of the open probability of the
                 channel model are generally consistent with
                 experimental data. A sixth state can be used to
                 simulate modal activity by way of introducing long
                 silent intervals. 6. Our model has been tested
                 extensively using experimental data from a wide variety
                 of voltage clamp protocols and bathing solution
                 manipulations. It provides: (a) biophysically based
                 explanations of putative mechanisms underlying Ca2+-
                 and voltage-dependent channel inactivation, and (b)
                 close fits to voltage clamp data. We conclude that the
                 model can serve as a predictive tool in generating
                 testable hypotheses for further investigation of this
                 complex ion channel.",

                 Moderate overexpression in clonally selected cell lines
                 did not have a detectible effect on actin filament
                 content or organization. Nevertheless, it promoted a
                 dose-dependent increase in rates of wound healing and
                 chemotaxis. The motile phenotype was similar to that
                 observed with gelsolin overexpression, which in
                 addition to capping, also severs and nucleates actin
                 filaments. CapG overexpressing clones are more
                 responsive to platelet-derived growth factor than
                 control-transfected clones. They form more circular
                 dorsal membrane ruffles, have higher phosphoinositide
                 turnover, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation and
                 Ca2+ signaling. These responses are consistent with
                 enhanced PLC gamma activity. Direct measurements of
                 PIP2 mass showed that the CapG effect on PLC gamma was
                 not due primarily to an increase in the PIP2 substrate
                 concentration. The observed changes in cell motility
                 and membrane signaling are consistent with the
                 hypothesis that PIP(2)-binding actin regulatory
                 proteins modulate phosphoinositide turnover and second
                 messenger generation in vivo. We infer that CapG and
                 related proteins are poised to coordinate membrane
                 signaling with actin filament dynamics following cell
                 stimulation.",

                 1). The presence, site of initiation, and direction of
                 propagation of Na+ and Ca2+ action potentials are,
                 however, controversial, and seem to be sensitive to
                 resting membrane potential, ionic composition, and
                 degree of channel inactivation, and depend on the
                 intensity and pattern of synaptic stimulation. This
                 makes it difficult to extrapolate from in vitro
                 experiments to the situation in the intact brain. Here
                 we show that two-photon excitation laser scanning
                 microscopy can penetrate the highly scattering tissue
                 of the intact brain. We used this property to measure

                 during whisker stimulation or current injection showed
                 increases in [Ca2+] only in coincidence with Na+ action
                 potentials. The amplitude of these [Ca2+] transients at
                 a given location was approximately proportional to the
                 number of Na+ action potentials in a short burst. The
                 amplitude for a given number of action potentials was
                 greatest in the proximal apical dendrite and declined
                 steeply with increasing distance from the soma, with
                 little Ca2+ accumulation in the most distal branches,
                 in layer 1. This suggests that widespread Ca2+ action
                 potentials were not generated, and any significant
                 [Ca2+] increase depends on somatically triggered Na+
                 action potentials.",

                 recording from InsP(3) receptors of RIN-5F cells, cells
                 in which the InsP(3) receptors are likely to be largely

                 Ehrlich (1998) Nature (London) 296, 81-84]. By using
                 antipeptide antisera that either selectively recognized
                 each InsP(3) receptor subtype or interacted equally
                 well with all subtypes, together with membranes from
                 Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells expressing only
                 single receptor subtypes to calibrate the
                 immunoblotting, we quantified the relative levels of
                 expression of type 1 (17\%) and type 3 (77\%) InsP(3)
                 receptors in RINm5F cells. In unidirectional (45)Ca(2+)
                 efflux experiments from permeabilized RINm5F cells,
                 submaximal concentrations of InsP(3) released only a
                 fraction of the InsP(3)-sensitive Ca(2+) stores,
                 indicating that responses to InsP(3) are quantal.
                 Increasing the cytosolic free [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](i))
                 from approx. 4 to 186 nM increased the sensitivity of
                 the Ca(2+) stores to InsP(3): the EC(50) decreased from
                 281+/-15 to 82+/-2 nM. Further increases in [Ca(2+)](i)
                 massively decreased the sensitivity of the stores to
                 InsP(3), by almost 10-fold when [Ca(2+)](i) was 2.4
                 \#M, and by more than 3000-fold when it was 100 \#M.
                 The inhibition caused by 100 \#M Ca(2+) was fully
                 reversed within 60 s of the restoration of [Ca(2+)](i)
                 to 186 nM. The effect of submaximal InsP(3)
                 concentrations on Ca(2+) mobilization from
                 permeabilized RINm5F cells is therefore biphasically
                 regulated by cytosolic Ca(2+). We conclude that type 3
                 InsP(3) receptors of RINm5F cells mediate quantal
                 Ca(2+) release and they are biphasically regulated by
                 cytosolic Ca(2+), either because a single type 1
                 subunit within the tetrameric receptor confers the
                 Ca(2+) inhibition or because the type 3 subtype is
                 itself directly inhibited by Ca(2+).",

                 represent a fundamental mechanism to meet the ATP
                 demand imposed by heart contractions, but the machinery
                 underlying propagation of [Ca(2+)] signals from
                 ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channels (RyR) to the
                 mitochondria remains elusive. Using permeabilized
                 cardiac (H9c2) cells we investigated the cytosolic
                 [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](c)) and [Ca(2+)](m) signals elicited
                 by activation of RyR. Caffeine, Ca(2+), and ryanodine
                 evoked [Ca(2+)](c) spikes that often appeared as
                 frequency-modulated [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations in these
                 permeabilized cells. Rapid increases in [Ca(2+)](m) and
                 activation of the Ca(2+)-sensitive mitochondrial
                 dehydrogenases were synchronized to the rising phase of
                 the [Ca(2+)](c) spikes. The RyR-mediated elevations of
                 global [Ca(2+)](c) were in the submicromolar range, but
                 the rate of [Ca(2+)](m) increases was as large as it
                 was in the presence of 30 microm global [Ca(2+)](c).
                 Furthermore, RyR-dependent increases of [Ca(2+)](m)
                 were relatively insensitive to buffering of [Ca(2+)](c)
                 by EGTA. Therefore, RyR-driven rises of [Ca(2+)](m)
                 appear to result from large and rapid increases of
                 perimitochondrial [Ca(2+)]. The falling phase of
                 [Ca(2+)](c) spikes was followed by a rapid decay of
                 [Ca(2+)](m). CGP37157 slowed down relaxation of
                 [Ca(2+)](m) spikes, whereas cyclosporin A had no
                 effect, suggesting that activation of the mitochondrial
                 Ca(2+) exchangers accounts for rapid reversal of the
                 [Ca(2+)](m) response with little contribution from the
                 permeability transition pore. Thus, rapid activation of
                 Ca(2+) uptake sites and Ca(2+) exchangers evoked by
                 RyR-mediated local [Ca(2+)](c) signals allow
                 mitochondria to respond rapidly to single [Ca(2+)](c)

                 induces apoptosis in hippocampal neurons in
                 stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP)
                 but not in Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). The overproduction
                 of oxygen-free radicals that occurs in the tissues of
                 SHRSP is implicated in reoxygenation injury after
                 hypoxia. Antioxidants inhibit reoxygenation injury in
                 hippocampal slices, and temporal cortices in
                 Alzheimer's disease increase sensitivity to oxygen-free
                 radicals. Because this sensitivity may contribute to
                 the development of the disease, we have studied hypoxia
                 and oxygen reperfusion using cortical neurons isolated
                 from WKY and SHRSP (at 15 days of gestation). We have
                 tried to determine whether cortical neurons are damaged
                 under these conditions, and whether neurons from SHRSP
                 are more vulnerable than those from WKY. We have tried
                 also to verify whether neuronal damage is minimized by
                 vitamin E using the following techniques: (a) Trypan
                 blue staining, (b) in situ staining of apoptosis, (c)
                 ultrastructural examination, and (d) measurement of
                 lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the bathing
                 medium. Furthermore, we have examined the mechanisms
                 involved in the development of neuronal damage and have
                 studied ways of minimizing it. We demonstrated that 36
                 hours of hypoxia significantly increased the rate of
                 cell death in SHRSP (p < 0.01), although 12 to 24 hours
                 of hypoxia did not increase cell death in either WKY or
                 SHRSP. In addition, 6 to 36 hours of hypoxia and 1.5 to
                 5 hours of oxygen reperfusion heavily damaged cells of
                 both WKY and SHRSP, and most became apoptotic or
                 necrotic. In contrast, cells incubated with 50 to 300
                 microg/ml of vitamin E remained intact, although 10 to
                 20 microg/ml of vitamin E did not totally preserve the
                 cells. Moreover, vitamin E protected the neurons from
                 high concentrations of sodium nitroprusside (nitric
                 oxide donor) in a dose-dependent manner. Vitamin E,
                 when added to the cells, increased in concentration in
                 a time-dependent manner over a 24-hour period and in a
                 dose-dependent manner below 200 microg/ml, and it was
                 detected mostly in the mitochondria. We also
                 demonstrated that serial treatments with allopurinol (a
                 xanthine oxidase inhibitor) or superoxide dismutase
                 preserved neurons during hypoxia and oxygen
                 reperfusion. These data indicate that SHRSP neurons are
                 weaker than WKY neurons in long-term hypoxia; oxygen
                 radical generation occurs in the early minutes after
                 reperfusion, and then the oxygen-free radicals cause
                 heavy damage to the cells; and antioxidants including
                 vitamin E react with the radicals, thereby preventing
                 apoptosis and necrosis. Therefore, antioxidants appear
                 to be the most important agents in lowering oxygen-free
                 radical damage in cortical neurons.",

                 in eukaryotes from yeast to human and constitute a
                 superfamily consisting of more than 100 members. This
                 superfamily is structurally classified into at least
                 five families: the Ras, Rho, Rab, Sar1/Arf, and Ran
                 families. They regulate a wide variety of cell
                 functions as biological timers (biotimers) that
                 initiate and terminate specific cell functions and
                 determine the periods of time for the continuation of
                 the specific cell functions. They furthermore play key
                 roles in not only temporal but also spatial
                 determination of specific cell functions. The Ras
                 family regulates gene expression, the Rho family

                 subcompartments characterized by an uneven distribution
                 of three proteins involved in Ca2+ storage and release:
                 the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor,

                 synapses in the mammalian brain involves changes in the
                 membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell. The use of
                 high-resolution cellular imaging has revealed
                 excitatory synapses at which postsynaptic, transient
                 alterations in calcium ion concentration are tightly
                 associated with electrical responses. Here, by
                 investigating the synapse between parallel
                 glutamatergic fibres and Purkinje cells in the mouse
                 cerebellum, we identify a class of postsynaptic
                 responses that consist of transient increases in
                 dendritic Ca2+ concentration but not changes in somatic
                 membrane potential. Our results indicate that these
                 synaptic Ca2+ transients are mediated by activation of
                 metabotropic glutamate-responsive mGluR1-type receptors
                 and require inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+

                 of stimulation, from individual spines to small
                 spinodendritic compartments. Thus, the synaptic
                 Ca2+-release signal may be one of the critical cues
                 that determine the input specificity of long-term
                 depression, a well-established form of

                 advantages for work on brain slices and bulk tissue.
                 However, it has very low signal levels compared to
                 conventional fluorescence microscopy. This is
                 disadvantageous in fast imaging applications when
                 photon shot noise is limiting. Working on brain slices
                 with excitation powers of 8-10 mW at the specimen
                 plane, the resting signal from cerebellar Purkinje cell
                 somas loaded with 10 microM Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1
                 averaged 4 detected photons/micros; axons of
                 interneurons loaded with 200 microM of this indicator
                 yielded about 1 photon/micros. To obtain satisfactory
                 images at high time resolution, long pixel dwell times
                 are required and data collection should be restricted
                 to as few pixels as necessary. Furthermore, a large
                 proportion of total measurement time (duty cycle)
                 should be available for data collection. We therefore
                 developed a method for scanning small regions of
                 interest with line repetition rates two to four times
                 higher than conventional ones and a duty cycle of 70\%.
                 We also compared the performance of several
                 photodetectors and found the optimum choice to depend
                 strongly on the photon flux during a given application.
                 For fluxes smaller than 5 photons/micros, the photon
                 counting avalanche photodiode shows the best signal to
                 noise ratio. At larger fluxes, photomultipliers or
                 intensified photodiodes are superior.",

  abstract =     "The metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR(1)) plays
                 a fundamental role in postnatal development and
                 plasticity of ionotropic glutamate receptor-mediated
                 synaptic excitation of cerebellar Purkinje cells.
                 Synaptic activation of mGluR(1) by brief tetanic
                 stimulation of parallel fibers evokes a slow excitatory
                 postsynaptic current and an elevation of intracellular
                 calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in Purkinje cells.
                 The mechanism underlying these responses has not been
                 identified yet. Here we investigated the responses to
                 synaptic and direct activation of mGluR(1) using whole
                 cell patch-clamp recordings in combination with
                 microfluorometric measurements of [Ca(2+)](i) in mouse
                 Purkinje cells. Following pharmacological block of
                 ionotropic glutamate receptors, two to six stimuli
                 applied to parallel fibers at 100 Hz evoked a slow
                 inward current that was associated with an elevation of
                 [Ca(2+)](i). Both the inward current and the rise in
                 [Ca(2+)](i) increased in size with increasing number of
                 pulses albeit with no clear difference between the
                 minimal number of pulses required to evoke these
                 responses. Application of the mGluR(1) agonist
                 (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (3,5-DHPG) by means of
                 short-lasting (5-100 ms) pressure pulses delivered
                 through an agonist-containing pipette positioned over
                 the Purkinje cell dendrite, evoked responses resembling
                 the synaptically induced inward current and elevation
                 of [Ca(2+)](i). No increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was observed
                 with inward currents of comparable amplitudes induced
                 by the ionotropic glutamate receptor agonist AMPA. The
                 3,5-DHPG-induced inward current but not the associated
                 increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was depressed when
                 extracellular Na(+) was replaced by choline, but,
                 surprisingly, both responses were also depressed when
                 bathing the tissue in a low calcium (0.125 mM) or
                 calcium-free/EGTA solution. Thapsigargin (10 &mgr;M)
                 and cyclopiazonic acid (30 &mgr;M), inhibitors of
                 sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, had little
                 effect on either the inward current or the elevation in
                 [Ca(2+)](i) induced by 3,5-DHPG. Furthermore, the
                 inward current induced by 3,5-DHPG was neither blocked
                 by
                 1-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]
                 ethyl-1H-imidazole, an inhibitor of store operated
                 calcium influx, nor by nimodipine or omega-agatoxin,
                 blockers of voltage-gated calcium channels. These
                 electrophysiological and Ca(2+)-imaging experiments
                 suggest that the mGluR(1)-mediated inward current,
                 although mainly carried by Na(+), involves influx of
                 Ca(2+) from the extracellular space.",

  abstract =     "Ca(2+) has been postulated as a cytosolic second
                 messenger in the regulation of cardiac oxidative
                 phosphorylation. This hypothesis draws support from the
                 well-known effects of Ca(2+) on muscle activity, which
                 is stimulated in parallel with the Ca(2+)-sensitive
                 dehydrogenases (CaDH). The effects of Ca(2+) on
                 oxidative phosphorylation were further investigated in
                 isolated porcine heart mitochondria at the level of
                 metabolic driving force (NADH or Deltapsi) and ATP
                 production rates (flow). The resulting force-flow (F-F)
                 relationships permitted the analysis of Ca(2+) effects
                 on several putative control points within oxidative
                 phosphorylation, simultaneously. The F-F relationships
                 resulting from additions of carbon substrates alone
                 provided a model of pure CaDH activation. Comparing
                 this curve with variable Ca(2+) concentration
                 ([Ca(2+)]) effects revealed an approximate twofold
                 higher ATP production rate than could be explained by a
                 simple increase in NADH or Deltapsi via CaDH
                 activation. The half-maximal effect of Ca(2+ )at state
                 3 was 157 nM and was completely inhibited by ruthenium
                 red (1 microM), indicating matrix dependence of the
                 Ca(2+) effect. Arsenate was used as a probe to
                 differentiate between F(0)/F(1)-ATPase and adenylate
                 translocase activity by a futile recycling of
                 ADP-arsenate within the matrix, catalyzed by the
                 F(0)/F(1)-ATPase. Ca(2+) increased the ADP arsenylation
                 rate more than twofold, suggesting a direct effect on
                 the F(0)/F(1)-ATPase. These results suggest that Ca(2+)
                 activates cardiac aerobic respiration at the level of
                 both the CaDH and F(0)/F(1)-ATPase. This type of
                 parallel control of both intermediary metabolism and
                 ATP synthesis may provide a mechanism of altering ATP
                 production rates with minimal changes in the
                 high-energy intermediates as observed in vivo.",

                 accumulation in the nucleus then nuclear envelope
                 breakdown. By immunofluorescence and by expressing a
                 GFP chimera of cyclin B, we find that cyclin B is
                 present in aggregates in the cytoplasm of immature
                 oocytes. The aggregates disperse at [~]10 min,
                 suggesting that the dispersal is closely related to the

                 cells evokes a rapid but transient rise in cytoplasmic
                 free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). The [Ca2+]i rise is
                 accompanied by a transient membrane hyperpolarization,
                 due to a several-fold increase in K+ conductance,

                 Pretreatment of the cells with a Ca2+-ionophore
                 abolishes the hormone-induced hyperpolarization but
                 leaves the depolarizing phase intact. The transient

                 incident nanosecond Ng:YAG 1064 nm radiation and
                 laser-induced fluorescence by 337 nm, pulsed nanosecond
                 nitrogen laser excitation, at 405, 410 and 415 nm
                 emission wavelengths were registered at eight
                 temperatures (40 degrees, 50 degrees, 55 degrees, 60
                 degrees, 65 degrees, 70 degrees, 75 degrees and 80
                 degrees C) and normalised with respect to the
                 corresponding values at the ambient temperature of 30
                 degrees C. The heating protocol used in this work, was
                 selected to monitor only permanent changes reflecting
                 in the optical properties of the samples under
                 investigation. In this context, the SHG, directly
                 related to the collagen fibril population in triple
                 helix conformation, indicated on irreversible phase
                 transition around 64 degrees C. On the other hand
                 fluorescence related to the destruction of cross-linked
                 chromophores in collagen, some of which are related to
                 the triple helix tertiary structure, also indicated a
                 permanent phase transition around 63 degrees C. These
                 results are in agreement with previous results from
                 studies with differential scanning calorimetry. However
                 SHG and fluorescence, being non-invasive optical
                 methods are expected to have a significant impact in
                 the fields of laser ablative surgery and laser tissue
                 welding.",

                 agonists causes both intracellular Ca2+ release and
                 activation of a voltage-independent cation current in
                 differentiated N1E-115 cells, a neuroblastoma cell line
                 derived from mouse sympathetic ganglia. Earlier work
                 showed that the membrane current requires an increase
                 in 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) produced
                 through the NO-synthase/guanylyl cyclase cascade and
                 suggested that the cells may express cyclic
                 nucleotide-gated ion channels. This was tested using
                 patch clamp methods. The membrane permeable cGMP
                 analogue, 8-br-cGMP, activates Na+ permeable channels
                 in cell attached patches. Single channel currents were
                 recorded in excised patches bathed in symmetrical Na+
                 solutions. cGMP-dependent single channel activity
                 consists of prolonged bursts of rapid openings and
                 closings that continue without desensitization. The
                 rate of occurrence of bursts as well as the burst
                 length increase with cGMP concentration. The unitary
                 conductance in symmetrical 160 mM Na+ is 47 pS and is
                 independent of voltage in the range -50 to +50 mV.
                 There is no apparent effect of voltage on opening
                 probability. The dose response curve relating cGMP
                 concentration to channel opening probability is fit by
                 the Hill equation assuming an apparent KD of 10 microm
                 and a Hill coefficient of 2. In contrast, cAMP failed
                 to activate the channel at concentrations as high as
                 100 microm. Cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) channels in
                 N1E-115 cells share a number of properties with CNG
                 channels in sensory receptors. Their presence in
                 neuronal cells provides a mechanism by which activation
                 of the NO/cGMP pathway by G-protein-coupled
                 neurotransmitter receptors can directly modify Ca2+
                 influx and electrical excitability. In N1E-115 cells,
                 Ca2+ entry by this pathway is necessary to refill the
                 IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pool during repeated
                 stimulation and CNG channels may play a similar role in
                 other neurons.",

                 expression in organotypic cultures of hippocampus and

                 coupled to different reporters (luciferase or

                 transduction are widely believed to require spatial
                 compartmentation of protein kinase and phosphatase
                 activities, yet existing methods for measuring kinase
                 activities in cells lack generality or spatial or
                 temporal resolution. We present three genetically
                 encoded fluorescent reporters for the tyrosine kinases
                 Src, Abl, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor.
                 The reporters consist of fusions of cyan fluorescent
                 protein (CFP), a phosphotyrosine binding domain, a
                 consensus substrate for the relevant kinase, and yellow
                 fluorescent protein (YFP). Stimulation of kinase
                 activities in living cells with addition of growth
                 factors causes 20-35\% changes in the ratios of yellow
                 to cyan emissions because of phosphorylation-induced
                 changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer

                 tyrosine kinase in the regulation of cell morphology.

                 The qualification was done using electrophysiologically

                 hippocampal slices stained with externally applied

                 Together with a newly designed CCD-based digital
                 high-speed camera system and epi-fluorescent optics,
                 our improvements were made on a protocol for staining

                 are producing an unprecedented mass of molecular
                 information for a wide range of model organisms. This
                 provides us with a detailed account of the cell with
                 which we may begin to build models for simulating
                 intracellular molecular processes to predict the
                 dynamic behavior of living cells. Previous work in
                 biochemical and genetic simulation has isolated
                 well-characterized pathways for detailed analysis, but
                 methods for building integrative models of the cell
                 that incorporate gene regulation, metabolism and
                 signaling have not been established. We, therefore,
                 were motivated to develop a software environment for
                 building such integrative models based on gene sets,
                 and running simulations to conduct experiments in
                 silico. Results : E-CELL, a modeling and simulation
                 environment for biochemical and genetic processes, has
                 been developed. The E-CELL system allows a user to
                 define functions of proteins, protein-protein
                 interactions, protein-DNA interactions, regulation of
                 gene expression and other features of cellular
                 metabolism, as a set of reaction rules. E-CELL
                 simulates cell behavior by numerically integrating the
                 differential equations described implicitly in these
                 reaction rules. The user can observe, through a
                 computer display, dynamic changes in concentrations of
                 proteins, protein complexes and other chemical
                 compounds in the cell. Using this software, we
                 constructed a model of a hypothetical cell with only
                 127 genes sufficient for transcription, translation,
                 energy production and phospholipid synthesis. Most of
                 the genes are taken from Mycoplasma genitalium, the
                 organism having the smallest known chromosome, whose
                 complete 580 kb genome sequence was determined at TIGR
                 in 1995. We discuss future applications of the E-CELL
                 system with special respect to genome engineering.

                 a technological problem that had previously defied
                 solution. Such a situation occurred in our work in the
                 development of a technique for the measurement of the
                 fastest technological events ever created - ultrashort
                 laser pulses - which can be as short as a few times
                 10/sup -15/s long. This time scale is several orders of
                 magnitude shorter than the fastest electronic
                 measurement devices, and so represents quite a
                 difficult problem. Previous methods achieved only vague
                 and indirect measures of such pulses. For example, the
                 standard method measures only the pulse intensity
                 autocorrelation. This measure gives only rough
                 information regarding the time-dependent intensity,
                 I(t), and it gives no information regarding the phase,
                 psi (t), of the full complex electric field, E(t), of
                 an ultrashort laser pulse. The authors discuss a device

                 both cytosolic Fluo 3 and mitochondrial Rhod 2
                 fluorescence occurred after electrical stimulation.
                 Ruthenium red, a blocker of the mitochondrial Ca(2+)
                 uniporter, inhibited mitochondrial Rhod 2 fluorescence
                 transients but not cytosolic Fluo 3 transients. Thus
                 the ruthenium red-sensitive mitochondrial Ca(2+)

                 beat-to-beat changes of mitochondrial fluorescence.
                 Only three-dimensionally resolved confocal imaging

                 weak process but is dipole allowed, therefore it occurs
                 in all materials, including dielectric materials with
                 inversion symmetry. We report that when using focused
                 high intensity ultrashort laser pulses, this normally
                 weak THG process becomes highly operative at a simple
                 air--dielectric interface and is much stronger than the
                 bulk of most dielectric materials. We characterized
                 this non-linear optical response at interfaces as a
                 phenomenological surface-enhanced THG in transmission
                 and/or in reflection. This surface THG is further
                 cascaded in transmission or reflection from layered
                 composite dielectric materials of a high--low index of
                 refraction, resulting in a marked increase in photon
                 conversion efficiency than that of a single interface.
                 Although the present THG efficiency is lower than that
                 of a typical phase-matching harmonic crystal, it is
                 important to note that the surface-enhanced optical THG
                 is a fundamental physical process occurring at all
                 interfaces and is relatively free from the constraint
                 of a phase-matching condition and wavelength
                 restriction. Using optical THG at an interface, it
                 becomes possible to generate wavelengths at which
                 harmonic crystals are unavailable. These findings may
                 lead to a new development of surface-enhanced studies
                 and prompt a re-examination of the processes of
                 high-harmonic generation at interfaces using a focused

                 rather difficult to distinguish optical signals from
                 individual, identified cells. We applied the optical
                 recording technique using a high-speed charge coupled

                 depolarizations lasting several hundred milliseconds,
                 Ca2+ fluorescence increased at a number of hotspots
                 around the base of the cell but changed little near the
                 hair bundle. The hotspots required influx of Ca2+
                 through voltage-dependent channels, and they expanded
                 during the pulse from an initial diameter of < 1
                 micron. Strong Ca2+ buffers like BAPTA slowed their
                 growth rate. On repolarization, the fluorescence
                 decayed with two time constants: approximately 0.1 s,
                 which may represent Ca2+ diffusion away from the entry
                 sites, and 10 s, probably reflecting Ca2+ extrusion.
                 Extrusion occurs mainly via a CaATPase that can be

                 channels from the basolateral cell membrane of rabbit
                 distal colon epithelium by reconstituting these
                 channels into planar bilayers consisting of different
                 1:1 mixtures of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE),
                 phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), and
                 phosphatidylinositol (PI). At low ambient K(+)
                 concentrations single-channel conductance is higher in
                 PE/PS and PE/PI bilayers than in PE/PC bilayers. At
                 high K(+) concentrations this difference in channel
                 conductance is abolished. Introducing the negatively
                 charged SDS into PE/PC bilayers increases channel
                 conductance, whereas the positively charged
                 dodecyltrimethylammonium has the opposite effect. All
                 these findings are consistent with modulation of

                 surrounding the channel. But the K(+) that permeates
                 the channel senses only a small fraction of the full

                 Ca(2+) and calmodulin were previously found to
                 maximally inhibit IP(3) binding to lbs-1 by 42+/-6 and

                 cells. Plasma membrane localization of the fluorescent
                 probe required the presence of three basic residues
                 within the PLCdelta PH domain known to form critical
                 contacts with PtdIns(4, 5)P2. Activation of endogenous
                 PLCs by ionophores or by receptor stimulation produced
                 rapid redistribution of the fluorescent signal from the
                 membrane to cytosol, which was reversed after Ca2+
                 chelation. In both ionomycin- and agonist-stimulated

                 correlated with changes in absolute mass of
                 PtdIns(4,5)P2. Inhibition of PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis by

                 consumption and metabolic state of working isolated

                 model shows that for phosphocreatine, creatine, and ATP

                 The model shows that workload-dependent alteration of
                 ADP concentration in the compartmentalized creatine
                 kinase system may be taken, together with the changes

                 for Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from endoplasmic

                 which employed several pharmacological tools (and in
                 particular caffeine and ryanodine) demonstrated that:
                 (i) caffeine induces intracellular calcium release in
                 various peripheral and central neurones; and (ii)
                 inhibition of CICR affects the parameters of
                 depolarization-triggered [Ca2+]c responses. Experiments
                 with caffeine demonstrated also that Ca2+ release from

                 coexistence of several subpopulations of Ca2+ release

                 cADPR is still unknown. CICR in neurones may be
                 important in creation of local [Ca2+]c signals and

                 of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the respiratory
                 chain, at the level of the coenzyme Q. The ROS attack

                 processing in different regions of the dendritic tree.
                 To examine the contribution of dendritic morphology to
                 the efficacy of propagation, simulations were performed
                 in detailed reconstructions of eight different neuronal
                 types. With identical complements of voltage-gated
                 channels, different dendritic morphologies exhibit
                 distinct patterns of propagation. Remarkably, the range
                 of backpropagation efficacies observed experimentally
                 can be reproduced by the variations in dendritic
                 morphology alone. Dendritic geometry also determines
                 the extent to which modulation of channel densities can
                 affect propagation. Thus in Purkinje cells and dopamine
                 neurons, backpropagation is relatively insensitive to
                 changes in channel densities, whereas in pyramidal
                 cells, backpropagation can be modulated over a wide
                 range. We also demonstrate that forward propagation of
                 dendritically initiated action potentials is influenced
                 by morphology in a similar manner. We show that these
                 functional consequences of the differences in dendritic
                 geometries can be explained quantitatively using simple
                 anatomical measures of dendritic branching patterns,
                 which are captured in a reduced model of dendritic
                 geometry. These findings indicate that differences in
                 dendritic geometry act in concert with differences in
                 voltage-gated channel density and kinetics to generate
                 the diversity in dendritic action potential propagation
                 observed between neurons. They also suggest that
                 changes in dendritic geometry during development and
                 plasticity will critically affect propagation. By
                 determining the spatial pattern of action potential
                 signaling, dendritic morphology thus helps to define
                 the size and interdependence of functional compartments

                 combines attributes from both near-field scanning
                 optical microscopy (NSOM) and fluorescence resonance
                 energy transfer (FRET). The method relies on attaching
                 the acceptor dye of a FRET pair to the end of a
                 near-field fiber optic probe. Light exiting the NSOM
                 probe, which is nonresonant with the acceptor dye,
                 excites the donor dye introduced into a sample. As the
                 tip approaches the sample containing the donor dye,
                 energy transfer from the excited donor to the tip-bound
                 acceptor produces a red-shifted fluorescence. By
                 monitoring this red-shifted acceptor emission, a
                 dramatic reduction in the sample volume probed by the
                 uncoated NSOM tip is observed. This technique is
                 demonstrated by imaging the fluorescence from a
                 multilayer film created using the Langmuir-Blodgett
                 (LB) technique. The film consists of
                 L-alpha-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)
                 monolayers containing the donor dye, fluorescein,
                 separated by a spacer group of three arachidic acid
                 layers. A DPPC monolayer containing the acceptor dye,
                 rhodamine, was also transferred onto an NSOM tip using
                 the LB technique. Using this modified probe,
                 fluorescence images of the multilayer film reveal
                 distinct differences between images collected
                 monitoring either the donor or acceptor emission. The
                 latter results from energy transfer from the sample to
                 the NSOM probe. This method is shown to provide
                 enhanced depth sensitivity in fluorescence
                 measurements, which may be particularly informative in
                 studies on thick specimens such as cells. The technique
                 also provides a mechanism for obtaining high spatial
                 resolution without the need for a metal coating around
                 the NSOM probe and should work equally well with
                 nonwaveguide probes such as atomic force microscopy
                 tips. This may lead to dramatically improved spatial
                 resolution in fluorescence imaging.",

                 endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase upon the frequency
                 of oscillations. By numerical simulations, we found

                 assuming that the different experiments were performed
                 at different stimulus levels. According to model
                 predictions, partial inhibition of internal calcium
                 pumps is expected to increase frequency at low stimulus
                 strength and should have an opposite effect at strong
                 stimuli. Similar results were obtained using an
                 analytical estimation of oscillation period, based on
                 calcium-dependent channel activation and inactivation.
                 In experiments on HeLa cells, 4 nM thapsigargin

                 dendrite vary as a function of the length of the spine
                 neck such that a short neck increases the magnitude of
                 the response in the dendrite and speeds up the recovery
                 in the spine head. The generality of the model,
                 originally constructed for a case of release of calcium
                 from stores, was tested in simulations of fast calcium
                 influx through membrane channels and verified the
                 impact of spine neck on calcium dynamics.
                 Spatiotemporal distributions of [Ca2+]i, measured in
                 individual dendritic spines of cultured hippocampal
                 neurons injected with Calcium Green-1, were monitored
                 with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Line scans
                 of spines and dendrites at a <1-ms time resolution
                 reveal simultaneous transient rises in [Ca2+]i in
                 spines and their parent dendrites after application of
                 caffeine or during spontaneous calcium transients
                 associated with synaptic or action potential
                 discharges. The magnitude of responses in the
                 individual compartments, spine-dendrite disparity, and
                 the temporal distribution of [Ca2+]i were different for
                 spines with short and long necks, with the latter being
                 more independent of the dendrite, in agreement with
                 prediction of the model.",

                 models of biological membranes and as a physiological
                 matrix for studying the structure and function of
                 membrane proteins and receptors. A common problem of
                 protein-lipid bilayers that are directly supported on a
                 hydrophilic substrate is nonphysiological interactions
                 of integral membrane proteins with the solid support to
                 the extent that they will not diffuse in the plane of
                 the membrane. To alleviate some of these problems we
                 have developed a new tethered polymer-supported planar
                 lipid bilayer system, which permitted us to
                 reconstitute integral membrane proteins in a laterally
                 mobile form. We have supported lipid bilayers on a
                 newly designed polyethyleneglycol cushion, which
                 provided a soft support and, for increased stability,
                 covalent linkage of the membranes to the supporting
                 quartz or glass substrates. The formation and
                 morphology of the bilayers were followed by total
                 internal reflection and epifluorescence microscopy, and
                 the lateral diffusion of the lipids and proteins in the
                 bilayer was monitored by fluorescence recovery after
                 photobleaching. Uniform bilayers with high lateral
                 lipid diffusion coefficients (0.8-1.2 x 10(-8) cm(2)/s)
                 were observed when the polymer concentration was kept
                 slightly below the mushroom-to-brush transition.
                 Cytochrome b(5) and annexin V were used as first test
                 proteins in this system. When reconstituted in
                 supported bilayers that were directly supported on
                 quartz, both proteins were largely immobile with mobile
                 fractions < 25\%. However, two populations of laterally
                 mobile proteins were observed in the polymer-supported
                 bilayers. Approximately 25\% of cytochrome b(5)
                 diffused with a diffusion coefficient of approximately
                 1 x 10(-8) cm(2)/s, and 50-60\% diffused with a
                 diffusion coefficient of approximately 2 x 10(-10)
                 cm(2)/s. Similarly, one-third of annexin V diffused
                 with a diffusion coefficient of approximately 3 x
                 10(-9) cm(2)/s, and two-thirds diffused with a
                 diffusion coefficient of approximately 4 x 10(-10)
                 cm(2)/s. A model for the interaction of these proteins
                 with the underlying polymer is discussed.",

                 (Biophysical Journal 75:2079-2087 (1998)) present
                 detailed measurements of the shape and speed of the
                 fertilization Ca2+ wave in Xenopus laevis eggs. In
                 order to help interpret their results, we develop here
                 a computational technique based on the finite element
                 method that allows us to carry out realistic
                 simulations of the fertilization wave. Our simulations
                 support the hypothesis that the physiological state of
                 the mature egg is bistable, i.e., that its cytoplasm
                 can accommodate two alternative physiological Ca2+
                 concentrations: a low concentration characteristic of
                 the prefertilization state and a greatly elevated
                 concentration characteristic of the state following the
                 passage of the wave. We explore this hypothesis by
                 assuming that the bistability is due to the release and
                 re-uptake properties of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
                 as determined by inositol trisphosphate (IP3)
                 receptor/Ca2+ channels and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum
                 calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps. When combined with
                 buffered diffusion of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm, our
                 simulations show that inhomogeneities in the Ca2+
                 release properties near the plasma membrane are
                 required to explain the temporal and spatial
                 dependences of the shape and speed of these waves. Our
                 results are consistent with an elevated IP3
                 concentration near the plasma membrane in the
                 unfertilized egg that is augmented significantly near
                 the site of fertilization. These gradients are
                 essential in determining the concave shape of the Ca2+
                 fertilization wave front.",

  abstract =     "Two intracellular calcium-release channel proteins,
                 the inositol trisphosphate (InsP3), and ryanodine
                 receptors, have been identified in mammalian and avian
                 cerebellar Purkinje neurons. In the present study,
                 biochemical and immunological techniques were used to
                 demonstrate that these proteins coexist in the same
                 avian Purkinje neurons, where they have different
                 intracellular distributions. Western analyses
                 demonstrate that antibodies produced against the InsP3
                 and the ryanodine receptors do not cross-react. Based
                 on their relative rates of sedimentation in continuous
                 sucrose gradients and SDS-PAGE, the avian cerebellar
                 InsP3 receptor has apparent native and subunit
                 molecular weights of approximately 1,000 and 260 kD,
                 while those of the ryanodine receptors are
                 approximately 2,000 and 500 kD. Specific [3H]InsP3- and
                 [3H]ryanodine-binding activities were localized in the
                 sucrose gradient fractions enriched in the 260-kD and
                 the approximately 500-kD polypeptides, respectively.
                 Under equilibrium conditions, cerebellar microsomes
                 bound [3H]InsP3 with a Kd of 16.8 nM and Bmax of 3.8
                 pmol/mg protein; whereas, [3H]ryanodine was bound with
                 a Kd of 1.5 nM and a capacity of 0.08 pmol/mg protein.
                 Immunolocalization techniques, applied at both the
                 light and electron microscopic levels, revealed that
                 the InsP3 and ryanodine receptors have overlapping, yet
                 distinctive intracellular distributions in avian
                 Purkinje neurons. Most notably the InsP3 receptor is
                 localized in endomembranes of the dendritic tree, in
                 both the shafts and spines. In contrast, the ryanodine
                 receptor is observed in dendritic shafts, but not in
                 the spines. Both receptors appear to be more abundant
                 at main branch points of the dendritic arbor. In
                 Purkinje neuron cell bodies, both the InsP3 and
                 ryanodine receptors are present in smooth and rough ER,
                 subsurface membrane cisternae and to a lesser extent in
                 the nuclear envelope. In some cases the receptors
                 coexist in the same membranes. Neither protein is
                 observed at the plasma membrane, Golgi complex or
                 mitochondrial membranes. Both the InsP3 and ryanodine
                 receptors are associated with intracellular membrane
                 systems in axonal processes, although they are less
                 abundant there than in dendrites. These data
                 demonstrate that InsP3 and ryanodine receptors exist as
                 unique proteins in the same Purkinje neuron. These
                 calcium-release channels appear to coexist in ER
                 membranes in most regions of the Purkinje neurons, but
                 importantly they are differentially distributed in
                 dendritic processes, with the dendritic spines
                 containing only InsP3 receptors.",

                 mitochondria. Autocrine motility factor receptor
                 (AMF-R) is a marker for a smooth subdomain of the ER,
                 shown here by confocal microscopy to be distinct from,

                 Ca2+ channels (LCCs) in the plasma membrane and Ca2+
                 release channels, commonly known as ryanodine
                 receptors, in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The Ca2+

                 formed by the cell surface and the sarcoplasmic

                 receptors to release Ca2+ in the form of Ca2+ sparks.

  abstract =     "1. Buffering of glutamate-induced Ca2+ loads in single
                 rat hippocampal neurons grown in primary culture was
                 studied with ratiometric fluorescent Ca2+ indicators.
                 The hypothesis that mitochondria buffer the large Ca2+
                 loads elicited by glutamate was tested. 2. The
                 relationship between glutamate concentration and the
                 resulting increase in the free intracellular Ca2+
                 concentration ([Ca2+]i) reached an asymptote at 30
                 microM glutamate. This apparent ceiling was not a
                 result of saturation of the Ca2+ indicator, because
                 these results were obtained with the low-affinity
                 (dissociation constant = 7 microM) Ca2+ indicator
                 coumarin benzothiazole. 3. Five minutes of exposure to
                 glutamate elicited concentration-dependent neuronal
                 death detected 20-24 h later by the release of the
                 cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase into the media.
                 Maximal neurotoxicity was elicited at glutamate
                 concentrations > or = 300 microM. The discrepancy
                 between the glutamate concentration required to evoke a
                 maximal rise in [Ca2+]i and the higher concentration
                 necessary elicit maximal Ca(2+)-triggered cell death
                 suggests that large neurotoxic Ca2+ loads are in part
                 removed to a noncytoplasmic pool. 4. Treatment of
                 hippocampal neurons with the protonophore carbonyl
                 cyanide p-(trifluoro-methoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 1
                 microM, 5 min) greatly increased the amplitude of
                 glutamate-induced [Ca2+]i transients, although it had
                 little effect on basal [Ca2+]i. The effect of FCCP was
                 more pronounced on responses elicited by stimuli that
                 produced large Ca2+ loads. Similar results were
                 obtained by inhibition of electron transport with
                 antimycin A1. Neither agent, under the conditions
                 described here, significantly depressed cellular ATP
                 levels as indicated by luciferase-based ATP
                 measurements, consistent with the robust anaerobic
                 metabolism of cultured cells. Thus inhibition of
                 mitochondrial function disrupted the buffering of
                 glutamate-induced Ca2+ loads in a manner that was not
                 related to changes in ATP. 5. Removal of extracellular
                 Na+ for 20 min before exposure to N-methyl-D-aspartate
                 (NMDA) (200 microM, 3 min), presumably reducing
                 intracellular Na+, evoked a prolonged plateau phase in
                 the recovery of the [Ca2+]i transient that resembled
                 the mitochondrion-mediated [Ca2+]i plateau previously
                 observed in sensory neurons. Return of extracellular
                 Na+ immediately after exposure to NMDA increased the
                 height and shortened the duration of the plateau phase.
                 Thus manipulation of extracellular Na+ altered the
                 plateau in a manner consistent with plateau height
                 being modulated by intracellular Na+ levels. 6. In
                 neurons depleted of Na+ and challenged with NMDA, a
                 plateau resulted; during the plateau, application of
                 FCCP in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ produced a
                 large increase in [Ca2+]i. In contrast, similar
                 treatment of cells that were not depleted of Na+ failed
                 to increase [Ca2+]i. Thus Na+ depletion traps Ca2+
                 within an FCCP-sensitive intracellular store. 7.
                 Glutamate-induced Ca2+ loads are sequestered by an
                 intracellular store that had a low affinity and a high
                 capacity for Ca2+, was released by FCCP, was sensitive
                 to antimycin A1, and was modulated by intracellular Na+
                 levels. We conclude that mitochondria sequester
                 glutamate-induced Ca2+ loads and suggest that Ca2+
                 entry into mitochondria may account for the poor
                 correlation between glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and
                 glutamate-induced changes in [Ca2+]i.",

                 cytoplasmic Ca(2+) homeostasis, delayed
                 Ca(2+)deregulation (DCD), is investigated for cultured
                 rat cerebellar granule cells exposed to glutamate. To
                 interpret the single-cell fluorescence response of
                 cells loaded with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester
                 (TMRM(+)) or rhodamine-123, we devised and validated a
                 mathematical simulation with well characterized
                 effectors of Deltapsi(m) and plasma membrane potential
                 (Deltapsi(P)). Glutamate usually caused an immediate
                 decrease in Deltapsi(m) of <10 mV, attributable to
                 Ca(2+) accumulation rather than enhanced ATP demand,
                 and these cells continued to generate ATP by oxidative
                 phosphorylation until DCD. Cells for which the
                 mitochondria showed a larger initial depolarization
                 deregulated more rapidly. The mitochondria in a
                 subpopulation of glutamate-exposed cells that failed to
                 extrude Ca(2+) that was released from the matrix after
                 protonophore addition were bioenergetically competent.
                 The onset of DCD during continuous glutamate exposure
                 in the presence or absence of oligomycin was associated
                 with a slowly developing mitochondrial depolarization,
                 but cause and effect could not be established readily.
                 In contrast, the slowly developing mitochondrial
                 depolarization after transient NMDA receptor activation
                 occurs before cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](c)) has
                 risen to the set point at which mitochondria retain
                 Ca(2+). In the presence of oligomycin no increase in
                 [Ca(2+)](c) occurs during this depolarization. We
                 conclude that transient Ca(2+) loading of mitochondria
                 as a consequence of NMDA receptor activation initiates
                 oxidative damage to both plasma membrane Ca(2+)
                 extrusion pathways and the inhibition of mitochondrial
                 respiration. Depending on experimental conditions, one

  abstract =     "Clustering of cell surface adhesion receptors is an
                 essential step in the development of focal contacts,
                 specialized cell-substrate attachment sites where
                 receptors are simultaneously linked to extracellular
                 ligand and cytoskeletal proteins. Previously, we
                 examined the effect of receptor clustering on
                 attachment strength. Here, we employ the numerical
                 methodology developed by Dembo and colleagues (Dembo,
                 M., D.C. Torney, K. Saxman, and D. Hammer. 1988. Proc.
                 R. Soc. Lond. B. 234:55-83) to investigate the kinetics
                 of cell detachment when receptors are clustered into
                 discrete patches. We show that the membrane peeling
                 velocity decreases if receptors are clustered within a
                 patch located inside the contact region. Peeling of
                 clusters is influenced by the chemistry and mechanics
                 of receptor-ligand bonds within the patch. Detachment
                 is also prohibited if the applied tension equals the
                 critical tension of the patch, unless the patch length
                 is small compared with the boundary length over which
                 membrane bending occurs, in which case the patch will
                 peel. Peeling of these short patches only occurs when
                 the mechanical stiffness of clustered bonds is within
                 an optimal range. We compare our model predictions with
                 experimental measurements of T lymphocyte detachment
                 from ICAM-1 substrates. We demonstrate that if discrete
                 patches of receptors are present, detachment occurs
                 through intervals of slow and fast peeling, similar to
                 the dynamics of T lymphocyte peeling, indicating that
                 clustering of LFA-1 receptors is one possible
                 explanation for the observed detachment kinetics in
                 this system.",

                 gated Ca channels play a key role in learning, though
                 they exhibit a low sensitivity to InsP(3) compared to
                 peripheral tissues. In the present study, the
                 cerebellar InsP(3) receptor is shown to be associated
                 with a novel inhibitor of InsP(3) binding. (3)H-InsP(3)
                 binding studies indicated that this inositol
                 trisphosphate receptor inhibitor (IRI) could completely
                 inhibit InsP(3) binding to the purified cerebellar
                 InsP(3) receptor and acted as a competitive inhibitor.
                 Gel filtration of IRI showed a predominant peak at 6500
                 Da, though this peak appeared to be an aggregate (with
                 a monomeric molecular mass of approximately 1500 Da).
                 Mass spectrometry of IRI showed a predominant peak at
                 1635 m/z, consistent with this low molecular mass
                 estimate. The inhibitory activity of IRI was prevented
                 by pretreatment with aryl sulfatase, suggesting the
                 presence of a critical sulfo ester in IRI. IRI was
                 insensitive to proteases and organic extraction but
                 bound to concanavalin A, suggesting that IRI is a
                 sulfated glycan. IRI was present in cerebellum but
                 below the level of detection in aorta. IRI was also
                 present in the neuronal cell line N1E115 (which
                 exhibits a low sensitivity to InsP(3)). We conclude
                 that IRI is a novel endogenous sulfated inhibitor of
                 the InsP(3) receptor that modulates the sensitivity of
                 the InsP(3) receptor and thus may explain the low
                 InsP(3) sensitivity of neurons.",

                 range of cellular functions, including vesicular
                 membrane traffic and cytoskeletal dynamics, by
                 recruiting functional protein complexes to restricted
                 locations in cellular membranes. However, little is
                 known about the distribution of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) in the
                 cell at high resolution. We have used the pleckstrin
                 homology (PH) domain of phospholipase delta(1)
                 (PLCdelta(1)), narrowly specific for PtdIns(4,5)P(2),
                 to map the distribution of the lipid in astrocytoma and
                 A431 cells. We applied the glutathione
                 S-transferase-tagged PLCdelta(1) PH domain
                 (PLCdelta(1)PH-GST) in an on-section labelling approach
                 which avoids transfection procedures. Here we
                 demonstrate PtdIns(4,5)P(2) labelling in the plasma
                 membrane, and also in intracellular membranes,
                 including Golgi (mainly stack), endosomes and
                 endoplasmic reticulum, as well as in electron-dense
                 structures within the nucleus. At the plasma membrane,
                 labelling was more concentrated over lamellipodia, but
                 not in caveolae, which contained less than 10\% of the
                 total cell-surface labelling. A dramatic decrease in
                 signal over labelled compartments was observed on
                 preincubation with the cognate headgroup
                 [Ins(1,4,5)P(3)], and plasma-membrane labelling was
                 substantially decreased after stimulation with
                 thrombin-receptor-activating peptide (SFLLRN in the
                 one-letter amino acid code), a treatment which markedly
                 diminishes PtdIns(4,5)P(2) levels. Thus we have
                 developed a highly selective method for mapping the
                 PtdIns(4,5)P(2) distribution within cells at high
                 resolution, and our data provide direct evidence for

                 whole-cell patch clamp recording techniques.
                 Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were activated by applying
                 depolarizing voltage steps through the pipette attached
                 at the soma in a voltage-clamp mode in the presence of
                 tetrodotoxin. Poor space clamp due to extensive
                 arborization of the dendrites allowed the dendrites to
                 fire Ca2+ spikes. Ca2+ imaging with Fura-2 injected
                 through the pipette, showed a steady [Ca2+]i increase
                 at the soma and transient, spike-linked [Ca2+]i jumps
                 in the dendrites. omega-Agatoxin-IVA (200 nM) abolished
                 the depolarization-induced Ca2+ spikes, the
                 spike-linked [Ca2+]i increase in the dendrites, and the
                 steady [Ca2+]i increase at the soma.
                 omega-Conotoxin-GVIA (5 microM) and nifedipine (3
                 microM) had no significant effect on the
                 depolarization-induced responses. In the presence of
                 4-aminopyridine(2 mM) and omega-Agatoxin-IVA, transient
                 [Ca2+]i increases remained in the dendrites. Low
                 concentrations of Ni2+(100 microM) reversibly
                 suppressed this [Ca2+]i increase. The voltage for
                 half-maximal activation and inactivation of this
                 component were lower than -50 mV and -31 mV,
                 respectively. In normal conditions, low concentration
                 of Ni2+ slowed the onset of the Ca2+ spike without
                 changing the time course of the spikes or the amplitude
                 of the accompanying [Ca2+]i increase. These results
                 show that omega-Agatoxin-IVA-sensitive Ca2+ channels
                 are distributed both in the soma and the dendrites, and
                 are responsible for dendritic Ca2+ spikes, whereas

                 distributed in the whole dendrites including both thick

                 biological systems to extremely low frequency (ELF)
                 electric and magnetic fields is a fundamental problem
                 of long-standing interest. We consider a two-state
                 model for voltage-gated channels in the membrane of an
                 isolated elongated cell (Lcell = 1 mm; rcell = 25
                 micron) and use a previously described process of ionic
                 and molecular flux rectification to set lower bounds
                 for a threshold exposure. A key assumption is that it
                 is the ability of weak physical fields to alter
                 biochemistry that is limiting, not the ability of a
                 small number of molecules to alter biological systems.
                 Moreover, molecular shot noise, not thermal voltage
                 noise, is the basis of threshold estimates. Models with
                 and without stochastic resonance are used, with a long
                 exposure time, texp = 10(4) s. We also determined the
                 dependence of the threshold on the basal transport
                 rate. By considering both spherical and elongated
                 cells, we find that the lowest bound for the threshold
                 is Emin approximately 9 x 10(-3) V m-1 (9 x 10(-5) V
                 cm-1). Using a conservative value for the loop radius
                 rloop = 0.3 m for induced current, the corresponding
                 lower bound in the human body for a magnetic field
                 exposure is Bmin approximately 6 x 10(-4) T (6 G).
                 Unless large, organized, and electrically amplifying
                 multicellular systems such as the ampullae of Lorenzini
                 of elasmobranch fish are involved, these results
                 strongly suggest that the biophysical mechanism of
                 voltage-gated macromolecules in the membranes of cells
                 can be ruled out as a basis of possible effects of weak
                 ELF electric and magnetic fields in humans.",

                 adhesion during locomotion, a double-view optical
                 technique and computer-assisted image analysis has been
                 developed which combines reflection interference
                 contrast microscopy (RICM) with bright-field imaging.
                 The simultaneous recording of cell-substratum contact
                 and cell body contour has been applied to
                 aggregation-competent cells of Dictyostelium
                 discoideum. These cells are distinguished from cells at
                 earlier stages of development by small areas of contact
                 to a substratum. Three questions have been addressed in
                 analysing the locomotion of aggregation-competent
                 cells. (1) What is the relationship between changes in
                 the shape of cells and their contact to a substratum
                 during a chemotactic response? (2) What is the
                 relationship between protrusion and retraction of the
                 cell body, and between local attachment and detachment?
                 (3) Are there differences between wild-type and mutant
                 cells that lack certain cytoskeletal proteins? During a
                 chemotactic response the front region of the amoeba can
                 bend towards the gradient of attractant without being
                 supported by its contact with a surface, which excludes
                 the necessity for gradients of adhesion for the
                 response. The finding that in locomoting cells
                 protrusion of the leading edge often precedes
                 retraction establishes a pioneer role for the front
                 region. The finding that gain of contact area precedes
                 loss provides evidence for the coordination of
                 interactions between the cell surface and a substratum.
                 For comparison with wild-type, aggregation-competent
                 triple mutant cells have been used that lack two
                 F-actin crosslinking proteins, alpha-actinin and 120
                 kDa gelation factor, and an actin filament fragmenting
                 protein, severin. Disturbances in the spatial and
                 temporal control of cytoskeletal activities have been
                 unravelled in the mutant by RICM and quantified by
                 cross-correlation analysis of attachment and detachment
                 vectors. In order to detect these disturbances, it was
                 essential to analyse cell locomotion on the weakly
                 adhesive surface of freshly cleaved mica.",

                 vesicle dynamics, in which synaptic depression is
                 attributed to depletion of a pool of release-ready
                 vesicles. Two alternative formulations of the model
                 allow for either recruitment of vesicles from an
                 unlimited reserve pool (vesicle state model) or for
                 recovery of a fixed number of release sites to a
                 release-ready state (release-site model). It is assumed
                 that, following transmitter release, the recovery of
                 the release-ready pool of vesicles is regulated by the
                 intracellular free Ca(++) concentration, [Ca(++)](i).
                 Considering the kinetics of [Ca(++)](i) after single
                 presynaptic action potentials, we show that pool
                 recovery can be described by two distinct kinetic
                 components. With such a model, complex kinetic and
                 steady-state properties of synaptic depression as found
                 in several types of synapses can be accurately
                 described. However, the specific assumption that
                 enhanced recovery is proportional to [Ca(++)](i), as
                 measured with Ca(++) indicator dyes, is not confirmed
                 by experiments at the calyx of Held, in which
                 [Ca(++)](i)-homeostasis was altered by adding low
                 concentrations of the exogenous Ca(++) buffer, fura-2,
                 to the presynaptic terminal. We conclude that synaptic
                 depression at the calyx of Held is governed by
                 localized, near membrane [Ca(++)](i) signals not
                 visible to the indicator dye, or else by an altogether
                 different mechanism. We demonstrate that, in models in
                 which a Ca(++)-dependent process is linearly related to
                 [Ca(++)](i), the addition of buffers has only transient
                 but not steady-state consequences.",

                 tissues has been a major problem in neurobiology. For
                 this aim different methods have been used such as viral
                 infection, microinjection, lipofection or calcium
                 phosphate precipitation. However, using these
                 techniques, very poor transfection efficiency was
                 achieved except for virus-mediated gene transfer.
                 Though viral infections are very efficient, this method
                 is expensive and labor-intensive, especially when
                 recombination is used to prepare viral vectors.
                 Biolistic gene transfer of neurons represents another
                 promising transfection technique. This technique was
                 originally used to transfect plant cells and has been
                 further developed for gene transfer into neurons or
                 neuronal tissues. Up to now, only a few reports are
                 available where successful biolistic gene transfer into
                 neurons or neuronal tissues could be shown.
                 Transfection efficiencies were only about 2\%. Most of
                 the previously published experiments were carried out
                 under vacuum conditions using in-chamber gene gun
                 types. Here we describe an improved method for
                 efficient neuronal cell transfection using a hand-held
                 gene gun. Expression vectors could be successfully
                 transferred into dissociated cultured hippocampal
                 neurons, PC12 cells, cultured cerebellar granule cells
                 and cerebellar brain slices. In cerebellar granule
                 cells and hippocampal neurons, transfection
                 efficiencies of about 10\% were reached.",

                 Antibodies that specifically recognize the alpha1

                 Class A P/Q-type Ca2+ channels were present mainly in a
                 punctate pattern in nerve terminals located along the
                 cell bodies and dendrites of motor neurons. Both smooth
                 and punctate staining patterns were observed over the

                 antibodies to class B N-type Ca2+ channels, indicating
                 the presence of these channels in the cell surface

                 and class E R-type Ca2+ channels were distributed

                 elements resulting in the development of a surface

                 gradients of surface tension with the highest values

                 NMDA receptor. In this study, we have measured striking

                 activation. Using indo-1 microfluorometry and a
                 specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+
                 exchanger, CGP-37157, we have demonstrated that
                 mitochondria accumulate large quantities of Ca2+ during

                 from mitochondria contributes to the prolonged [Ca2+]i

                 membrane potential (delta psi), to show that Ca2+
                 accumulation within the organelle dissipates delta psi.
                 The abrupt loss of delta psi after glutamate
                 stimulation did not occur in the presence of MK801 or
                 in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The mitochondrial
                 depolarizationwas also cyclosporin A-sensitive,
                 indicating a probable role for the permeability

                 buffer glutamate-induced, NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+
                 influx. Here, we have used the fluorescent calcium
                 indicator, indo-1 AM to record [Ca2+]i from single
                 cells. We varied either the glutamate concentration or
                 the duration of exposure to investigate the cellular
                 mechanisms recruited to buffer [Ca2+]i within different
                 stimulation protocols. 2. For a 15 s stimulus, the
                 recovery time doubled as the glutamate concentration
                 was raised from 3 to 300 microM. Changing the duration
                 of exposure from 15 s to 5 min increased the recovery
                 time tenfold even when the glutamate concentration was
                 held at 3 microM. 3. We used a selective inhibitor of
                 the mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange, CGP-37157. When
                 applied immediately after a 15 s, 100 microM glutamate
                 challenge, CGP-37157 consistently caused a rapid fall
                 in [Ca2+]i followed by a slow rise after the drug was
                 washed out. A similar pattern was seen with the 5 min,
                 3 microM glutamate stimulus. The effects of CGP-37157
                 are consistent with the release of substantial
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ stores during recovery from an
                 intense glutamate stimulus. 4. These studies suggest
                 that mitochondria become progressively more important
                 for buffering glutamate-induced Ca2+ loads as the
                 stimulus intensity increases. The recovery of [Ca2+]i
                 to baseline following glutamate removal is critically
                 regulated by the release of Ca2+ from mitochondrial
                 stores via mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. The data
                 highlight a previously under-appreciated role for
                 [Na+]i in the regulation of [Ca2+]i in central
                 neurones.",

                 normal neural activity is associated with changes in

                 computational work that employs such fluctuations in an

                 external calcium that accrue during neural activity. In
                 this realistic setting, we showed that rapid,
                 significant changes in local external calcium can occur
                 when dendrites are invaded by back-propagating spikes,
                 even in the presence of an extracellular calcium
                 buffer. We further showed how different geometric
                 arrangements of calcium channels or dendrites prolong
                 or amplify these fluctuations. Finally, we computed the
                 influence of experimentally measured synaptic input on
                 peridendritic calcium fluctuations. Remarkably,
                 appropriately timed synaptic input can amplify
                 significantly the decrement in external calcium. The
                 model shows that the extracellular space and the
                 calcium channels that access it provide a medium that
                 naturally integrates coincident spike activity from
                 different dendrites that intersect the same tissue

                 basal turnover of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
                 (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and M3-muscarinic receptor-mediated
                 changes in phosphoinositides in the human neuroblastoma
                 cell line, SH-SY5Y. We demonstrate that the
                 polyphosphoinositides represent a minor fraction of the
                 total cellular phosphoinositide pool and that in
                 addition to rapid, sustained increases in [3H]inositol
                 phosphates dependent upon the extent of receptor
                 activation by carbachol, there are equally rapid and
                 sustained reductions in the levels of
                 polyphosphoinositides. Compared with
                 phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P),
                 PtdIns(4,5)P2 was reduced with less potency by
                 carbachol and recovered faster following agonist
                 removal suggesting protection of PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the
                 expense of PtdIns(4)P and indicating specific
                 regulatory mechanism(s). This does not involve a
                 pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein regulation of
                 PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase. Using wortmannin to inhibit PtdIns
                 4-kinase activity, we demonstrate that the immediate
                 consequence of blocking the supply of PtdIns(4)P (and
                 therefore PtdIns(4,5)P2) is a failure of
                 agonist-mediated phosphoinositide and Ca2+ signaling.
                 The use of wortmannin also indicated that PtdIns is not
                 a substrate for receptor-activated phospholipase C and
                 that 15\% of the basal level of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is in an
                 agonist-insensitive pool. We estimate that the
                 agonist-sensitive pool of PtdIns(4,5)P2 turns over
                 every 5 s (0.23 fmol/cell/min) during sustained
                 receptor activation by a maximally effective
                 concentration of carbachol. Immediately following
                 agonist addition, PtdIns(4,5)P2 is consumed >3 times
                 faster (0.76 fmol/cell/min) than during sustained
                 receptor activation which represents, therefore,
                 utilization by a partially desensitized receptor. These
                 data indicate that resynthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is
                 required to allow full early and sustained phases of
                 receptor signaling. Despite the critical dependence of
                 phosphoinositide and Ca2+ signaling on PtdIns(4,5)P2
                 resynthesis, we find no evidence that this rate
                 resynthesis is limiting for agonist-mediated
                 responses.",

  abstract =     "Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells predominantly
                 express the type II receptor for inositol
                 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), which operates as an
                 InsP3-gated calcium channel. In these cells,
                 cross-linking the high-affinity immunoglobulin E
                 receptor (FcepsilonR1) leads to activation of
                 phospholipase C gamma isoforms via tyrosine kinase- and
                 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathways,
                 release of InsP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores,
                 and a sustained phase of Ca2+ influx. These events are
                 accompanied by a redistribution of type II InsP3
                 receptors within the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear
                 envelope, from a diffuse pattern with a few small
                 aggregates in resting cells to large isolated clusters
                 after antigen stimulation. Redistribution of type II
                 InsP3 receptors is also seen after treatment of RBL-2H3
                 cells with ionomycin or thapsigargin. InsP3 receptor
                 clustering occurs within 5-10 min of stimulus and
                 persists for up to 1 h in the presence of antigen.
                 Receptor clustering is independent of endoplasmic
                 reticulum vesiculation, which occurs only at ionomycin
                 concentrations >1 microM, and maximal clustering
                 responses are dependent on the presence of
                 extracellular calcium. InsP3 receptor aggregation may
                 be a characteristic cellular response to
                 Ca2+-mobilizing ligands, because similar results are
                 seen after activation of phospholipase C-linked
                 G-protein-coupled receptors; cholecystokinin causes
                 type II receptor redistribution in rat pancreatoma
                 AR4-2J cells, and carbachol causes type III receptor
                 redistribution in muscarinic receptor-expressing
                 hamster lung fibroblast E36(M3R) cells. Stimulation of
                 these three cell types leads to a reduction in InsP3
                 receptor levels only in AR4-2J cells, indicating that
                 receptor clustering does not correlate with receptor
                 down-regulation. The calcium-dependent aggregation of
                 InsP3 receptors may contribute to the previously
                 observed changes in affinity for InsP3 in the presence
                 of elevated Ca2+ and/or may establish discrete regions

  abstract =     "It has been widely reported that the in vivo
                 administration of glucagon to rats results in the
                 stimulation of calcium influx in subsequently isolated
                 liver mitochondria. The mechanism of this effect is
                 investigated through simultaneous measurements of
                 calcium uptake rate and mitochondrial membrane
                 potential. This allows the measurement of the calcium
                 uniporter conductance independent of hormonal effects
                 on electron transport or respiration. Two experimental
                 approaches are used. The first involves measuring the
                 uptake of 40-50 nmol of Ca2+/mg of mitochondrial
                 protein with the calcium dye antipyrylazo III; the
                 second uses 45Ca2+ to follow uptake in the presence of
                 0.5 to 1.5 microM free calcium, buffered with HEDTA. In
                 both cases a tetraphenyl phosphonium electrode is used
                 to follow membrane potential, and membrane potential is
                 varied using either malonate or butylmalonate in the
                 presence of rotenone. The relative merits of these two
                 approaches are discussed. The conductance of the
                 calcium uniporter is found not to be stimulated by
                 glucagon pretreatment. Also, the relative glucagon
                 stimulation of both calcium influx and membrane
                 potential is found to increase with increasing malonate
                 concentration. These results imply that there is no
                 direct stimulation of calcium uptake into liver
                 mitochondria following glucagon treatment. The results
                 are consistent with a glucagon stimulation of substrate
                 transport, substrate oxidation, or a stimulation of
                 electron transport resulting in an increased membrane
                 potential and secondary stimulation of calcium

                 calcium loads from 2 to 60 nmol/mg with emphasis on the
                 lower portion of this range. A procedure has been
                 developed through which mitochondria may be depleted of
                 endogenous calcium (initially in the range of 6-10
                 nmol/mg following preparation) to values as low as 2
                 nmol/mg, without involving substrate depletion or
                 de-energization. Mitochondria depleted of calcium by
                 this technique are more resistant to the
                 calcium-induced permeability transition than are those
                 depleted by the older procedures and are therefore
                 appropriate for the kinetics studies. Calcium depletion
                 is necessary in studying the kinetics of
                 sodium-independent calcium efflux in order to bring
                 efflux to a rate considerably less than 50\% of the
                 saturation rate. The results of these studies show
                 cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 1.9 +/- 0.2.
                 They have been fit to an equation representative either
                 of a nonessential activation mechanism with a single
                 transport site or of an Adair-Pauling mechanism with
                 two transport sites. From the fit of the data to this
                 equation, a Vmax of 1.2 +/- 0.1 nmol/mg/min and a
                 concentration of half-maximal activity of 8.4 +/- 0.6
                 nmol/mg have been obtained. The possible role of
                 phosphate in controlling the Vmax of this transporter
                 has been evaluated by measuring efflux as a function of
                 calcium load at three different concentrations of total
                 inorganic phosphate: 20 microM, 120 microM, and 1 mM.
                 Failure of the maximum transport velocity to decrease
                 with increasing inorganic phosphate indicates that the
                 extreme flatness of the saturation portion of the
                 velocity versus calcium concentration curve observed is
                 not the result of precipitation of calcium with
                 inorganic phosphate but is an inherent property of this
                 efflux mechanism.",

                 extramitochondrial sodium concentrations (5 to 40 mM).
                 The resulting data can be fit to a terreactant model
                 which exhibits simultaneous kinetics (i.e. both sodium
                 and calcium must be bound simultaneously for transport
                 to occur). The Hill coefficients for the calcium and
                 sodium dependences were 1.0 +/- 0.1 and 2.0 +/- 0.2,
                 respectively. The cooperativity of the sodium
                 dependence allows the terreactant model to be reduced
                 to a bireactant model in which the sodium concentration

                 temporal resolution of 15 microns and about 20

                 Ca(2+) signal largely determines the amount of released
                 quanta and thus the size of the synaptic response.
                 Ca(2+)-channel function is modulated in particular by
                 the auxiliary beta-subunits that interact
                 intracellularly with the pore-forming alpha(1)-subunit.
                 Using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer in cultured
                 hippocampal neurons, we demonstrate that functional
                 GFP-beta(4) constructs colocalize with the synaptic

                 hippocampal neurons infected with green fluorescent
                 protein (GFP)-beta(4) revealed an increase in both
                 excitatory post-synaptic current amplitude and paired

  abstract =     "BACKGROUND: Many microorganisms, including
                 myxobacteria, cyanobacteria, and flexibacteria, move by
                 gliding. Although gliding always describes a slow
                 surface-associated translocation in the direction of
                 the cell's long axis, it can result from two very
                 different propulsion mechanisms: social (S) motility
                 and adventurous (A) motility. The force for S motility
                 is generated by retraction of type 4 pili. A motility
                 may be associated with the extrusion of slime, but
                 evidence has been lacking, and how force might be
                 generated has remained an enigma. Recently, nozzle-like
                 structures were discovered in cyanobacteria from which
                 slime emanated at the same rate at which the bacteria
                 moved. This strongly implicates slime extrusion as a
                 propulsion mechanism for gliding. RESULTS: Here we show
                 that similar but smaller nozzle-like structures are
                 found in Myxococcus xanthus and that they are clustered
                 at both cell poles, where one might expect propulsive
                 organelles. Furthermore, light and electron
                 microscopical observations show that slime is secreted
                 in ribbons from the ends of cells. To test whether the
                 slime propulsion hypothesis is physically reasonable,
                 we construct a mathematical model of the slime nozzle
                 to see if it can generate a force sufficient to propel
                 M. xanthus at the observed velocities. The model
                 assumes that the hydration of slime, a cationic
                 polyelectrolyte, is the force-generating mechanism.
                 CONCLUSIONS: The discovery of nozzle-like organelles in
                 various gliding bacteria suggests their role in
                 prokaryotic gliding. Our calculations and our
                 observations of slime trails demonstrate that slime
                 extrusion from such nozzles can account for most of the
                 observed properties of A motile gliding.",

                 Conformational changes in the protein subunits may

                 Here we present a molecular mechanism by which these

                 cycle, such as ATP hydrolysis, to the dynamics of

                 deformations that generate propulsive forces. We
                 demonstrate this possibility for two classes of

                 the intracellular calcium stores through inositol

                 performed in cultured Purkinje cells, however, find

                 receptors. To address this discrepancy, the properties
                 of InsP(3)-and caffeine-evoked calcium release in
                 cultured Purkinje cells were directly examined.
                 Photorelease of InsP(3) (up to 100 microM) from its
                 photolabile caged analogue produced no change in
                 calcium levels in 70\% of cultured Purkinje cells. In
                 the few cells where a calcium increase was detected,
                 the response was very small and slow to peak. In
                 contrast, the same concentration of InsP(3) resulted in
                 large and rapidly rising calcium responses in all
                 acutely dissociated Purkinje cells tested. Similar to
                 InsP(3), caffeine also had little effect on calcium
                 levels in cultured Purkinje cells, yet evoked large
                 calcium transients in all acutely dissociated Purkinje
                 cells tested. The results demonstrate that calcium
                 release from intracellular calcium stores is severely
                 impaired in Purkinje cells when they are maintained in
                 culture. Our findings suggest that cultured Purkinje
                 cells are an unfaithful experimental model for the

                 second messenger cascades may be functionally

                 messenger transients that might be seen at the base of

                 sustained increases in second messenger concentration
                 in the spine head were communicated to the spine base

                 extrusion mechanisms for understanding the dynamics of

                 rat cardiac myocytes were investigated by confocal
                 laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) using the fluorescent
                 Ca2+-indicator fluo-3 AM. As recently shown, a
                 spreading wave of enhanced cytosolic calcium appears,
                 most probably during Ca2+ overload, and is initiated by
                 an elementary event called a calcium spark. When
                 measured by conventional fluorescence microscopy the
                 propagation velocity of spontaneous calcium waves
                 determined at several points along the cardiac myocyte
                 was previously found to be constant. More precise
                 measurements with a CLSM showed a nonlinear
                 propagation. The wave velocity was low, close to the
                 focus, and increased with increasing time and
                 propagation length, approaching a maximum of 113
                 microns/s. This result was surprising, inasmuch as for
                 geometrical reasons a decrease of the propagation
                 velocity might be expected if the confocal plane is not
                 identical with that plane where the focus of the wave
                 was localized. It is suggested that the propagation
                 velocity is essentially dependent on the curvature of
                 the spreading wave. From the linear relationship of
                 velocity versus curvature, a critical radius of 2.7 +/-
                 1.4 microns (mean +/- SD) was worked out, below which
                 an outward propagation of the wave will not take place.
                 Once released from a sufficiently extended cluster of
                 sarcoplasmic reticulum release channels, calcium
                 diffuses and will activate its neighbors. While
                 traveling away, the volume into which calcium diffuses
                 becomes effectively smaller than at low radii. This
                 effect is the consequence of the summation of
                 elementary events (Ca2+ sparks) and leads to a steeper
                 increase of the cytosolic calcium concentration after a
                 certain diffusion path length. Thus the time taken to
                 reach a critical threshold of [Ca2+]i at the
                 neighboring calcium release sites decreases with
                 decreasing curvature and the wave will propagate
                 faster.",

                 each step. These include excitation of an organic
                 antenna, transfer of energy from the antenna to

                 Xenopus oocytes to determine how it could modulate
                 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3))-induced Ca(2+)
                 influx. Under conditions where it did not affect the

                 Deletion mutants revealed that CRT requires its high

                 types of excitatory inputs. Climbing fiber (CF)
                 synapses have a high probability of release and show
                 paired-pulse depression (PPD), whereas parallel fiber
                 (PF) synapses facilitate and have a low probability of
                 release. We examined both types of synapses using
                 serial electron microscopic reconstructions in 15-d-old
                 rats to look for anatomical correlates of these
                 differences. PF and CF synapses were distinguishable by
                 their overall ultrastructural organization. There were
                 differences between PF and CF synapses in how many
                 release sites were within 1 &mgr;m of a mitochondrion
                 (67 vs 84\%) and in the degree of astrocytic
                 ensheathment (67 vs 94\%). However, the postsynaptic
                 density sizes for both types of synapses were similar
                 (0.13-0.14 &mgr;m(2)). For both types of synapses, we
                 counted the number of docked vesicles per release site
                 to test whether this number determines the probability
                 of release and synaptic plasticity. PF and CF synapses
                 had the same number of anatomically docked vesicles
                 (7-8). The number of docked vesicles at the CF does not
                 support a simple model of PPD in which release of a
                 single vesicle during the first pulse depletes the
                 anatomically docked vesicle pool at a synapse.
                 Alternatively, only a fraction of anatomically docked
                 vesicles may be release ready, or PPD could result from
                 multivesicular release at each site. Similarities in
                 the number of docked vesicles for PF and CF synapses
                 indicate that differences in probability of release are
                 unrelated to the number of anatomically docked vesicles

                 (InsP(3)R) is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular
                 Ca(2+) channel that mediates complex cytoplasmic Ca(2+)
                 signals, regulating diverse cellular processes,
                 including synaptic plasticity. Activation of the
                 InsP(3)R channel is normally thought to require binding
                 of InsP(3) derived from receptor-mediated activation of
                 phosphatidylinositol lipid hydrolysis. Here we identify
                 a family of neuronal Ca(2+)-binding proteins as
                 high-affinity protein agonists of the InsP(3)R, which
                 bind to the channel and activate gating in the absence
                 of InsP(3). CaBP/caldendrin, a subfamily of the
                 EF-hand-containing neuronal calcium sensor family of
                 calmodulin-related proteins, bind specifically to the
                 InsP(3)-binding region of all three InsP(3)R channel
                 isoforms with high affinity (K(a) approximately 25 nM)
                 in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner (K(a) approximately 1
                 microM). Binding activates single-channel gating as
                 efficaciously as InsP(3), dependent on functional
                 EF-hands in CaBP. In contrast, calmodulin neither bound
                 with high affinity nor activated channel gating. CaBP1
                 and the type 1 InsP(3)R associate in rat whole brain
                 and cerebellum lysates, and colocalize extensively in
                 subcellular regions in cerebellar Purkinje neurons.
                 Thus, InsP(3)R-mediated Ca(2+) signaling in cells is
                 possible even in the absence of InsP(3) generation, a
                 process that may be particularly important in
                 responding to and shaping changes in intracellular
                 Ca(2+) concentration by InsP(3)-independent pathways

                 cells, are both triggered by the elevation of
                 postsynaptic intracellular calcium concentration
                 ([Ca2+]i). To understand how one signaling molecule can
                 be responsible for triggering two opposing forms of
                 synaptic modulation, different postsynaptic [Ca2+]i
                 elevation patterns were generated by a new caged
                 calcium compound nitrophenyl-ethylene
                 glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic

                 patterns of [Ca2+]i elevation selectively activate LTP

                 contrast, a prolonged modest rise of [Ca2+]i reliably
                 induced LTD. An important implication of the results is
                 that both the amplitude and the duration of an

                 Ca(2+) indicators designed to measure the free Ca(2+)
                 concentration in the cytoplasm, [Ca(2+)](cyt), and the
                 endoplasmic reticulum (ER), [Ca(2+)](er). Basal
                 [Ca(2+)](cyt) was about 50 nm; thyrotropin-releasing
                 hormone (TRH) or other agonists increased [Ca(2+)](cyt)
                 to 1 micrometer or higher. Basal [Ca(2+)](er) averaged
                 500 micrometer and fell to 50-100 micrometer over 10
                 min in the presence of thapsigargin. TRH consistently
                 decreased [Ca(2+)](er) to 100 micrometer, independent
                 of extracellular Ca(2+), whereas agonists for
                 endogenous receptors generally caused a smaller
                 decline. When added with thapsigargin, all agonists
                 rapidly decreased [Ca(2+)](er) to 5-10 micrometer,
                 indicating that there is substantial store refilling
                 during signaling. TRH increased [Ca(2+)](cyt) and
                 decreased [Ca(2+)](er) if applied after other agonists,
                 whereas other agonists did not alter [Ca(2+)](cyt) or
                 [Ca(2+)](er) if added after TRH. When Ca(2+) was added
                 back to cells that had been incubated with TRH in
                 Ca(2+)-free medium, [Ca(2+)](cyt) and [Ca(2+)](er)
                 increased rapidly. The increase in [Ca(2+)](er) was
                 only partially blocked by thapsigargin but was
                 completely blocked if cells were loaded with 1,
                 2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid.
                 In conclusion, these new Ca(2+) indicators showed that
                 basal [Ca(2+)](er) is approximately 500 micrometer,
                 that [Ca(2+)](er) has to be >100 micrometer to support
                 an increase in [Ca(2+)](cyt) by agonists, and that
                 during signaling, intracellular Ca(2+) stores are
                 continuously refilled with cytoplasmic Ca(2+) by the

                 work on spine calcium dynamics. Calcium influx into
                 spines is mediated by calcium channels and by NMDA and
                 AMPA receptors and is followed by fast diffusional
                 equilibration within the spine head. Calcium decay

                 spine neck and by spine calcium pumps. Calcium release
                 occurs in spines, although its role is controversial.
                 Finally, the endogenous calcium buffers in spines
                 remain unknown. Thus, spines are calcium compartments
                 because of their morphologies and local influx and

                 understood. Using two-photon calcium imaging of CA1
                 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices, we
                 investigated the mechanisms by which calcium enters
                 into individual spines in the stratum radiatum. We find
                 three different pathways for calcium influx:
                 high-threshold voltage-sensitive calcium channels, NMDA
                 receptors, and an APV-resistant influx consistent with
                 calcium-permeable AMPA or kainate receptors. These
                 pathways vary among different populations of spines and
                 are engaged under different stimulation conditions,
                 with peak calcium concentrations reaching >10 microM.
                 Furthermore, as a result of the biophysical properties
                 of the NMDA receptor, the calcium dynamics of spines
                 are exquisitely sensitive to the temporal coincidence
                 of the input and output of the neuron. Our results

                 compartments that can perform coincidence detection.

                 dependence of calcium release was developed and tested.
                 Three gating models of the RyRC, showing, respectively,
                 an increase, no change, and a decrease in calcium
                 sensitivity over time, were compared. The described
                 method of analysis enabled determination of temporal

                 detection of the adaptation/inactivation phenomena of

                 structural constraints on imported proteins. An
                 unprecedented sensitive dependence on these constraints
                 was seen in the voltage-gated import and channel
                 formation by the C-terminal pore-forming domain of the
                 bacteriocin, colicin E1. At physiological ionic
                 strengths, significant channel current was observed
                 only in a narrow interval of anionic lipid content
                 ([L(-)]), with the maximum current (I(max)) at 25-30
                 mol\% (dioleoyl)-phosphatidylglycerol ([L(-)](max))
                 corresponding to a surface potential of the lipid
                 bilayer in the absence of protein, psi(o)(max) = -60
                 +/- 5 mV. Higher ionic strength shifted [L(-)](max) to
                 larger values, but psi(o)(max) remained approximately
                 constant. It is proposed that the channel current (i)
                 increases and (ii) decreases at psi(o) values <55 mV
                 and >65 mV, because of (i) electrostatic interactions
                 needed for effective insertion of the channel
                 polypeptide and (ii) constraints due to electrostatic
                 forces on the flexibility needed for cooperative
                 insertion into the membrane. The loss of flexibility
                 for psi(o) 65 mV was demonstrated by the absence of
                 thermally induced intraprotein distance changes of the
                 bound polypeptide. The anionic lipid content, 25-30
                 mol\%, corresponding to the channel current maxima, is
                 similar to that of the target Escherichia coli
                 cytoplasmic membrane and membranes of mesophilic
                 microorganisms. This suggests that one reason the
                 membrane surface potential is tuned in vivo is to
                 facilitate protein import.",

                 neurons make the precise topographic connections
                 necessary for function. The hypothesis that transient
                 expression of calcium (Ca2+) signaling molecules may
                 have a role in this process was tested by studying
                 human cerebella at midgestation. In addition, four
                 adult brains, two controls and two from patients with
                 ataxia, were studied as well. The temporal and spatial
                 distribution of intracellular Ca2+ channel/receptors,
                 inositol trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1) and
                 ryanodine receptor (RyR) and three Ca2+ binding
                 proteins were examined with immunocytochemical methods.
                 A positive immune reaction with all markers of Ca2+
                 signaling was found in the Purkinje cell layer starting
                 from 17 g.w. (gestational weeks), the youngest age
                 studied. The immune reactions were not homogeneous
                 throughout the extent of the Purkinje cell layer, but
                 instead displayed a 'patchy' appearance in all
                 intrauterine stages. In the adult cerebellum the
                 expression of Ca2+ signaling molecules was homogenous.
                 In the two cerebella obtained from patients suffering
                 from ataxia, a several-fold reduction of immunostaining
                 with IP3R1 was found. Our findings suggest that
                 transient and differential mobilization of
                 intracellular Ca2+ in seemingly homogenous neuronal
                 types may play a role in development of highly
                 organized projection maps of the cerebellar cortex.
                 Moreover, lack of IP3R1 in the diseased brains suggests
                 that internal stores of Ca2+ play an important role in
                 normal function of the cerebellum.",

                 intracellular mechanism by which the directional signal
                 is transduced. Ca2+ is a key second messenger in growth
                 cone extension and has been implicated in growth-cone
                 turning. Here I report that a direct, spatially
                 restricted elevation of intracellular Ca2+
                 concentration ([Ca2+]i) on one side of the growth cone
                 by focal laser-induced photolysis (FLIP) of caged Ca2+
                 consistently induced turning of the growth cone to the

                 medium, no filopodia asymmetry was induced by the
                 glutamate gradient, and no growth cone turning was
                 observed. Furthermore, elimination of filopodia with a
                 low concentration of cytochalasin B completely
                 abolished the turning response without substantially
                 affecting neurite extension. Thus, filopodia may be
                 required for chemotropic guidance of the growth cone,
                 and an asymmetry in filopodia distribution may be an
                 early cellular event responsible for determining the
                 direction the growth cone advances.",

                 Kinetic analysis using 45Ca2+ indicated that the

                 were loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester form of indo-1
                 (indo-1 AM) such that approximately 75\% of cellular
                 indo-1 was mitochondrial. The intramitochondrial indo-1
                 concentration was 0.5-2 mM. 2. Myocytes were also
                 voltage clamped (membrane capacitance, Cm = 100 pF) and
                 a typical wash-out time constant of cytosolic indo-1 by
                 a patch pipette was found to be approximately 300 s.
                 Depolarizations to +110 mV produced graded and
                 progressive cellular Ca2+ load via Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange.
                 3. During these relatively slow Ca2+ transients, cell
                 contraction (delta L) paralleled fluorescence ratio
                 signals (R) such that delta L could be used as a
                 bioassay of cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c), where [Ca2+]CL
                 is the inferred signal which is delayed by
                 approximately 200 ms from true [Ca2+]c. 4. In myocytes
                 without Mn2+ quench, the kinetics of the total cellular
                 indo-1 signal, delta R (including cytosolic and
                 mitochondrial components), match delta L during
                 stimulations at low basal [Ca2+]i. However, after
                 progressive Ca2+ loading, delta R kinetics deviate from
                 delta L dramatically. The deviation can be completely
                 blocked by a potent mitochondrial Ca2+ uniport blocker,
                 Ru360. 5. When cytosolic indo-1 is quenched by Mn2+,
                 initial moderate stimulation triggers contractions
                 (delta L), but no change in indo-1 signal, indicating
                 both the absence of cytosolic Ca(2+)-sensitive indo-1
                 and unchanged mitochondrial [Ca2+] (delta [Ca2+]m).
                 Subsequent stronger stimulation evoked larger delta L
                 and also delta R. The threshold [Ca2+]c for
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was 300-500 nM, similar to
                 that without Mn2+ quench. 6. At high Ca2+ loads where
                 delta [Ca2+]m is detected, the time course of [Ca2+]m
                 was different from that of [Ca2+]c. Peak [Ca2+]m after
                 stimulation has an approximately 1 s latency with
                 respect to [Ca2+]c, and [Ca2+]m decline is extremely
                 slow. 7. Upon a Ca2+ influx which increased [Ca2+]c by
                 0.4 microM and [Ca2+]m by 0.2 microM, total
                 mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was approximately 13 mumol (1
                 mitochondria)-1. 8. With Mn2+ quench of cytosolic
                 indo-1, there was no mitochondrial uptake of Mn2+ until
                 the point at which mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake became
                 apparent. However, after mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake
                 starts, mitochondria continually take up Mn2+ even
                 during relaxation, when [Ca2+]c is low. 9. It is
                 concluded that mitochondria in intact myocytes do not
                 take up detectable amounts of Ca2+ during individual
                 contractions, unless resting [Ca2+]c exceeds 300-500
                 nM. At high cell Ca2+ loads and [Ca2+]c, mitochondrial
                 Ca2+ transients occur during the twitch, but with much
                 slower kinetics than those of [Ca2+]c.",

  abstract =     "Ca(2+) sparks are highly localized cytosolic Ca(2+)
                 transients caused by a release of Ca(2+) from the
                 sarcoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptors (RyRs);
                 they are the elementary events underlying global
                 changes in Ca(2+) in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In
                 smooth muscle and some neurons, Ca(2+) sparks activate
                 large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (BK
                 channels) in the spark microdomain, causing spontaneous
                 transient outward currents (STOCs) that regulate
                 membrane potential and, hence, voltage-gated channels.
                 Using the fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator fluo-3 and a
                 high speed widefield digital imaging system, it was
                 possible to capture the total increase in fluorescence
                 (i.e., the signal mass) during a spark in smooth muscle
                 cells, which is the first time such a direct approach
                 has been used in any system. The signal mass is
                 proportional to the total quantity of Ca(2+) released
                 into the cytosol, and its rate of rise is proportional
                 to the Ca(2+) current flowing through the RyRs during a
                 spark (I(Ca(spark))). Thus, Ca(2+) currents through
                 RyRs can be monitored inside the cell under
                 physiological conditions. Since the magnitude of
                 I(Ca(spark)) in different sparks varies more than
                 fivefold, Ca(2+) sparks appear to be caused by the
                 concerted opening of a number of RyRs. Sparks with the
                 same underlying Ca(2+) current cause STOCs, whose
                 amplitudes vary more than threefold, a finding that is
                 best explained by variability in coupling ratio (i.e.,
                 the ratio of RyRs to BK channels in the spark
                 microdomain). The time course of STOC decay is
                 approximated by a single exponential that is
                 independent of the magnitude of signal mass and has a
                 time constant close to the value of the mean open time
                 of the BK channels, suggesting that STOC decay reflects
                 BK channel kinetics, rather than the time course of
                 [Ca(2+)] decline at the membrane. Computer simulations
                 were carried out to determine the spatiotemporal
                 distribution of the Ca(2+) concentration resulting from
                 the measured range of I(Ca(spark)). At the onset of a
                 spark, the Ca(2+) concentration within 200 nm of the
                 release site reaches a plateau or exceeds the
                 [Ca(2+)](EC50) for the BK channels rapidly in
                 comparison to the rate of rise of STOCs. These findings
                 suggest a model in which the BK channels lie close to
                 the release site and are exposed to a saturating
                 [Ca(2+)] with the rise and fall of the STOCs determined
                 by BK channel kinetics. The mechanism of signaling
                 between RyRs and BK channels may provide a model for
                 Ca(2+) action on a variety of molecular targets within
                 cellular microdomains.",

                 muscle cells was defined using a snapshot imaging
                 technique. Calcium imaging was performed on intact
                 skeletal and cardiac muscle cells during contractions
                 induced by an action potential (AP). The sarcomere
                 length of the skeletal and cardiac cells was
                 approximately 2 &mgr;m. Imaging Rhod-2 fluorescence
                 only during a very brief (7 ns) snapshot of excitation
                 light minimized potential image-blurring artifacts due
                 to movement and/or diffusion. In skeletal muscle cells,
                 the AP triggered a large fast Ca(2+) transient that
                 peaked in less than 3 ms. Distinct subsarcomeric Ca(2+)
                 gradients were evident during the first 4 ms of the
                 skeletal Ca(2+) transient. In cardiac muscle, the
                 AP-triggered Ca(2+) transient was much slower and
                 peaked in approximately 100 ms. In contrast to the
                 skeletal case, there were no detectable subsarcomeric
                 Ca(2+) gradients during the cardiac Ca(2+) transient.
                 Theoretical simulations suggest that the subsarcomeric
                 Ca(2+) gradients seen in skeletal muscle were
                 detectable because of the high speed and synchrony of
                 local Ca(2+) release. Slower asynchronous recruitment
                 of local Ca(2+) release units may account for the
                 absence of detectable subsarcomeric Ca(2+) gradients in
                 cardiac muscle. The speed and synchrony of local Ca(2+)
                 gradients are quite different in AP-activated
                 contracting cardiac and skeletal muscle cells at normal
                 resting sarcomere lengths.",

                 optical sectioning capability for high-resolution
                 imaging. Most multiphoton microscopy studies in
                 biological systems have relied on two-photon excited
                 fluorescence (TPEF) to produce images. With increasing
                 applications of multiphoton microscopy to thick-tissue
                 intravital imaging, second-harmonic generation (SHG)
                 from structural proteins has emerged as a potentially
                 important new contrast mechanism. However, SHG is
                 typically detected in transmission mode, thus limiting
                 TPEF/SHG coregistration and its practical utility for
                 in vivo thick-tissue applications. In this study, we
                 use a broad range of excitation wavelengths (730-880
                 nm) to demonstrate that TPEF/SHG coregistration can
                 easily be achieved in unstained tissues by using a
                 simple backscattering geometry. The combined TPEF/SHG
                 technique was applied to imaging a three-dimensional
                 organotypic tissue model (RAFT). The structural and
                 molecular origin of the image-forming signal from the
                 various tissue constituents was determined by
                 simultaneous spectroscopic measurements and confirming
                 immunofluorescence staining. Our results show that at
                 shorter excitation wavelengths (<800 nm), the signal
                 emitted from the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a
                 combination of SHG and TPEF from collagen, whereas at
                 longer excitation wavelengths the ECM signal is
                 exclusively due to SHG. Endogenous cellular signals are
                 consistent with TPEF spectra of cofactors NAD(P)H and
                 FAD at all excitation wavelengths. The reflected SHG
                 intensity follows a quadratic dependence on the
                 excitation power, decays exponentially with depth, and
                 exhibits a spectral dependence in accordance with
                 previous theoretical studies. The use of SHG and TPEF
                 in combination provides complementary information that
                 allows noninvasive, spatially localized in vivo
                 characterization of cell-ECM interactions in unstained

                 whole-cell current-recording configuration of the

                 muscle cells is opened by caffeine (Guerrero, A., F.S.
                 Fay, and J.J. Singer. 1994. J. Gen. Physiol.
                 104:375-394). The localized fluorescence transients
                 appeared to occur at random locations on the cell
                 membrane, with the duration of the rising phase
                 matching the duration of the channel opening. Moreover,
                 these transients were only observed in the presence of
                 sufficient extracellular Ca(2+), suggesting that they
                 are due to Ca(2+) influx from the bathing solution. The
                 fluorescence transient is characterized by an initial
                 fast rising phase when the channel opens, followed by a
                 slower rising phase during prolonged openings. When the
                 channel closes there is an immediate fast falling phase
                 followed by a slower falling phase. Computer
                 simulations of the underlying events were used to
                 interpret the time course of the transients. The rapid
                 phases are mainly due to the establishment or removal
                 of Ca(2+) and Ca(2+)-bound fluo-3 gradients near the
                 channel when the channel opens or closes, while the
                 slow phases are due to the diffusion of Ca(2+) and
                 Ca(2+)-bound fluo-3 into the cytoplasm. Transients due
                 to short channel openings have a Ca(2+) spark-like
                 appearance, suggesting that the rising and early
                 falling components of sparks (due to openings of
                 ryanodine receptors) reflect the fast phases of the
                 fluorescence change. The results presented here suggest
                 methods to determine the relationship between the
                 fluorescence transient and the underlying Ca(2+)
                 current, to study intracellular localized Ca(2+)
                 handling as might occur from single Ca(2+) channel

                 electron frozen. The present work suggests that the
                 energies of these resonances correspond, when the

                 the energies of resonances associated with the

                 patterns, including transient, sustained, and
                 oscillatory behavior. These Ca(2+) changes have been
                 well characterized, but detailed kinetic analyses of
                 PLC activation in single living cells is lacking, due
                 to the absence of suitable indicators for use in vivo.
                 Recently, green fluorescent protein-tagged pleckstrin
                 homology domains have been employed to monitor PLC
                 activation in single cells, based on (confocal) imaging
                 of their fluorescence translocation from the membrane
                 to the cytosol that occurs upon hydrolysis of
                 phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate. Here we describe
                 fluorescence resonance energy transfer between
                 pleckstrin homology domains of PLCdelta1 tagged with
                 cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins as a sensitive
                 readout of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate metabolism
                 for use both in cell populations and in single cells.
                 Fluorescence resonance energy transfer requires
                 significantly less excitation intensity, enabling
                 prolonged and fast data acquisition without the cell
                 damage that limits confocal experiments. It also allows
                 experiments on motile or extremely flat cells, and can
                 be scaled to record from cell populations as well as
                 single neurites. Characterization of responses to
                 various agonists by this method reveals that stimuli
                 that elicit very similar Ca(2+) mobilization responses
                 can exhibit widely different kinetics of PLC
                 activation, and that the latter appears to follow
                 receptor activation more faithfully than the cytosolic
                 Ca(2+) transient.",

                 activate PI turnover and thereby trigger intracellular
                 calcium release. Previously, we demonstrated that
                 mGluRs form natural complexes with members of a family
                 of Homer-related synaptic proteins. Here, we present
                 evidence that Homer proteins form a physical tether
                 linking mGluRs with the inositol trisphosphate
                 receptors (IP3R). A novel proline-rich Homer ligand
                 (PPXXFr) is identified in group 1 mGluRs and IP3R, and
                 these receptors coimmunoprecipitate as a complex with
                 Homer from brain. Expression of the IEG form of Homer,
                 which lacks the ability to cross-link, modulates
                 mGluR-induced intracellular calcium release. These
                 studies identify a novel mechanism in calcium signaling
                 and provide evidence that an IEG, whose expression is
                 driven by synaptic activity, can directly modify a
                 specific synaptic function.",
